"Rachel Ray the American Jamie Oliver the Karen of cooking she destroyed her she destroyed Pad Thai today let's see if she destroy Filipino adopo it's a Filipino classic chicken adobo so you start with a big old Dutch oven and brown up two pieces and her adult portion okay so if you're entertaining six people do 12 pieces you brown that in some olive oil olive oil no olive oil for Asian food olive oil Asian food just like carbon fiber and submarine they don't go together Uncle Roger gonna start a group called just stop olive oil in the bottom of your Browning correct until it's nice and crispy on both sides now it's gonna get spicy and good what you certainly sound like that it's gonna get spicy and good why her voice like that spicy and good what kind of ghost possess her is it the ghost of bad cooking because adobo not supposed to be spicy now we're gonna add just a drizzle more oil because I barely got any dripping even more olive oil the first level of is coarse black pepper pepper spoons don't be cheap on the black pepper it's essential in the dish but so I'm just eyeballing but it's a bit weird to throw black pepper in now usually we add black pepper into the marinade not straight into oil like this it couldn't get burnt pot of course black pepper we're going to reserve half of the chilies chili wrong dish and we're going to add half to the pot I uh even if chili correct why are you using jalapeno that Mexican if you want to use chili use Filipino chili sealing La puyo she have to change location of chili like how you change location with expressvpn the sponsor of this video if you like watching show and you're not using expense VPN what you doing hi service like Netflix or Disney plus I think so many show from you because of where you live what you see is the iceberg and then you're only getting just the tip look at this USA Netflix got 6300 title pretty good but Canada has more and UK even more Netflix actually got more than 17 000 titles but you can't see them all from just one country that's why you need expressvpn it lets you change your location checking Netflix into showing you all the show look this show so funny cannot find in us

Marshall Netflix racing price to 15 a month you deserve more than just the tip so listen to Uncle Roger go to expressvpn.com Uncle Roger to get three month free or quick Link in description love literally bulbs of crushed garlic garlic good really a lot of garlic in the sauce nice lots of fresh bay fresh bay bay bay leaf good and fresh bay is gonna be uncle Roger only fan nickname give that a stir and it will clear out your sinuses by the by so keep your head back a little bit from the pot and then a large bunch of scallions or green onions when they're spring onion Uncle Roger don't cook inside the adobo uncle just use spring onion at the end like topping or it's Jamie Olive would like to call it spring onion is pimpage the ultimate pimpage and we put the whites in the pot and reserve the tops or the greens for when the dish is done okay at least you've got some at the end now we're going to add three quarters a cup of vinegar be good correct hmm But Uncle Roger won't put vinegar straight in hot pan like that also it's gonna reduce too much your adobo gonna be more sour than my ex-wife that's about six turns of the pan what that what'd she say that's about six turns of the pan six ton of pan what kind of [\u00a0__\u00a0] measurement is that high uh surely it depends on how fast you pour how big the pan is everything that's like asking someone how long you're gonna take oh not long just like six walk in the park if you want to give [\u00a0__\u00a0] measurement like this just say use feeling okay use Feeling Just Paul winika listen to your ancestor spirit that's about six turns of the pan that will also clear your sinuses out so back it up this woman just obsessed with clearing her sinuses your sinus got problem just go see doctor hi uh and then we're gonna put in about the exact same amount of soy or I'm using chamari tamari what is tamari so tamari just means gluten-free soy sauce it's Rachel why you like soy sauce for weak people why who these weak people who can't handle soy sauce who get killed by soy sauce in Asia almost every meal have soy sauce how you live your life imagine at your funeral people go he died doing what he loved eating dim sum just use regular soy sauce or if you want to impress Filipino people use Silver Swan brand okay or I'm using chamari H soy sauce how many turn off pan is that okay and then we're going to sweeten it up with about two tablespoons of light brown sugar sugar nice coating over the top oh my God it smells so good that was coming out again but it smells so good [Music] Uncle Roger don't feel comfortable and now we're going to drop the heat way down correct and let the finish the chicken cook to finish through nice okay at least you put chicken back in we'll come out you can just leave Chicken in there and cook all in one pot no need to separate out but so far so good is Rachel big Improvement except for olive oil all the steps actually pretty correct just have to leave it in pot let it cook and your adobo gonna be okay I'm going to think this might actually turn out decent Famous Last Word we're gonna leave this covered and simmering for about 35 minutes lid on nice heat way down garlic rice is a really big deal in Filipino cookings correct garlic rice classic Filipino dish so we're going to take another whole bulb of garlic crush it and throw it into with chicken stock what we're gonna call no no you don't boil garlic garlic rice you just fried the garlic fried the rice and put together that's it you do boiling garlic cook our rice in chicken stock rather than no extra flavor in any cooking show if Uncle Roger sea rice going into saucepan I know it's not gonna end well it's up to a boil now we're going to reduce to simmer and I'm going to add coffee under seed coriander no what the hell why you putting random [\u00a0__\u00a0] into your rice you put coriander seed in like this when the rice done cooking you're not gonna be able to take the seed out you're eating fluffy rice and then suddenly you've got crunchy coriander seed in there who wants that you're gonna break your tooth lid on you know the drill here the truth is to use rice cooker and let that cook up about 15 minutes turn it off let it stand five minutes more for our chicken it's just been gently simmering but at least the adobo look okay we're gonna take it back out and then we're going to turn the heat up because now we have all the juice from the chicken itself I fished out the five fresh bay leaves from our Adobo sauce for our chicken meanwhile I cooked rice now I'm gonna finish with a nice fat sprinkle of toasted seven no gives it a great extra oh oh my God he's a nephew look at this rice that fries look disgusting a clumpy rice with raw boy garlic and coriander seed lying around Ankara just so upset I have to put my leg down from chair I uh this Rachel what you doing the adobo looking okay all that left to do is to make plain simple white rice and you still [\u00a0__\u00a0] up high with a nice fat sprinkle of toasted sesame you don't need sesame seeds you need Jesus you need Jesus anything that adds texture and flavor I say go for it no no don't just don't anything that adds texture and flavor I say go for it what is white people obsession with texture plain white rice the texture perfect no need to add random [\u00a0__\u00a0] texture to it what the hell Asian people were eating white rice for millions of years it's good enough for us [\u00a0__\u00a0] your texture texture not something you put to fix your [\u00a0__\u00a0] food a toasted seed Sesame and coriander lots of garlic and pour that sauce down over our chicken actually look good and then we're gonna top the chicken with our jalapeno jalapeno rum our green onions green onion okay a little cilantro or parsley cilantro parsley no no no you're making the same mistake nephew soup guy make parsley in Adobo a little cilantro or parsley and also cilantro and parsley not the same thing just just oh how can professional chef not notice just because they're both tiny green leaf parsley and cilantro still completely different thing one tastes like [\u00a0__\u00a0] the other tastes like cilantro they under seed in the rice nice [Applause] stop clapping stop clapping how they get these audience in oh do you want to check out professional chef destroying rice come I got just a show for you do we draw such promising start and then this Rachel just lose her way with the Rice High yeah he's a nephew my next video Uncle Roger gonna make a topo show you how it's done so subscribe now if you

enough you know I love Chinese food I mean I'll eat anywhere anytime any place so when I get here and I find out there's a joint this dude it's a real deal Chinese food but with some true Nolan's attitude you know I gotta check it out what his little he looked like Phil rock star Uncle Roger called this look no custody I wonder what it would look like without that hair sorry why are you laughing are you laughing because he looks better with the Frosted I think nephew kind the only guy in the world who looked better with frosted tip he looked like the failed Mario brother it looks like the Mario dad the Mario thing yeah Chef Max just rocked out it's an experience that sort of gets you out of your lane in New Orleans all right guys coming in local flavors surf Chinese style crawfish rangoons in the window and Easter takes on Western Classics cheeseburger fried rice up oh no exactly what it is Cheeseburger fried rice pretty much oh look at this this not fire rice that looks so wet too Saucy but not in the right way only Auntie Esther should be this wet what's up Uncle Roger confused also what the requirement to work at this restaurant three-year experience and four neck tattoo is it all chefs like that are you not like that no no no Asian people cannot get tattooed your mom's gonna beat you up that's the reason scared of my mom does everything that a cheeseburger has in it it's almost like a dirty rice it's fantastic this is where things are gonna get weird folks this is when the New Orleans attitude steps in we're gonna make the cheeseburger fried rice but it's gonna taste like fried rice it's gonna taste like a cheeseburger if you search dictionary for the word vegan this guy photo show up I didn't know you could look the opposite of Andrew Tate but the Chopstick in his head oh fried rice when you're messing with my fried rice you're messing with my emotions that could save so we're gonna start by making the awesome sauce that's the sauce that goes on top of the cheeseburger awesome sauce awesome sauce I'm going to love how American name that thing awesome sauce brilliant beef you have to stop calling your food hainanese chicken rice you'll be calling it amazing chicken rice yeah because it is okay no too hot no aircon do you want towel if you start sweating I'm not I don't want your towel why I don't know where it's been You've Been Everywhere exactly odd bit of sweat on here face sweat ball sweat all the sweat absolutely gonna have a lot of blooper for this region awesome sauce yeah we've got pickle chips made into a relish three egg yolks now I'm gonna add minced garlic mushroom powder you love that mushroom powder drizzle in a little bit of soy oil so we just made pickle relish garlic aioli absolutely all right the sound of the sauce actually sounds really nice like on a burger or something else but the fact that I just heard it go onto the bowl that's going to go on the rice just makes me feel a bit grossed out to be honest holy absolutely all right we're in the awesome zone now I'm going to fold in the ketchup uh no ketchup too much sweetness in your fire right this almost like chili jamla whoa now I'm gonna fold in the ketchup so a really fantastic scratch made Thousand Island all right now Thousand Island essentially mayonnaise and ketchup American people love the mayonnaise you know they put it on Everything Sushi potato coleslaw and now fried rice all right yeah all right now we're gonna make the cheeseburger fried rice how many beats you use probably about 120 000. 120 000 BTU that good uncle Roger approved that nice walk nice guest of nice fire how many BTU your kitchen have zero see you induction remember it's very very good very strong how you measure induction I just measure it in how many pound coins it costs me to turn it on expensive when they sell you induction stove how you know how big it can go it's just really really strong kilowatts so is there conversion between BTU and kilowatts okay okay I need to do your research before doing this it's just raw talk this video that's raw talk in this reaction video you know how much I like sorry that way you've got two children an energy guy raw talk too much I'm gonna need that clothing and flushing it yeah you think my uncle like a bar set cloth oh gosh niece and nephew if you're in London go check out Auntie list restaurant Main the food's so good thank you Singaporean restaurant but almost Malaysian level food speaking of good stuff Uncle Roger got new much look at this limited edition orange MSG houthi the

this very nice you can also get the matching sweatpants for you get the whole set give them to your mom your dad your thought whatever show them how cool you are go to uncle rogermatch.com right now to buy it this hoodie quality too good uncle Roger sweating even more thank you thank you oh I didn't know Jamie Oliver is my fan for this mounts now I got ground beef a little Bacon fat in there the only ingredient Ankara to like is the Bacon fat that like pork like adds so much good flavor but all the other stuff the onion is so big it looked a little bit too dark for my liking so I'm not not colored very nicely we're gonna fry the rice it doesn't get any better than this white sugar what what white sugar sugar yeah for your fried rice you do this you can do it sugar salt msgs like the three good ingredients for a fried rice yeah you don't need you don't need sugar salty it's nice because you put like the bacon and the beef so maybe they're trying to balance that saltiness maybe but there's so much sugar in the ketchup sauce yeah I think this American people taste they like sweet a lot yeah a lot sweeter it doesn't get any better than this white sugar a little bit of mushroom powder mushroom powder sneaky way to say MSG Frio white people got so many ways to say MSG without saying MSG they got chicken bouillon chicken stock cute parmesan anchovies Tomatoes mushroom powder lettuce whoa I didn't see that coming Roman Tomatoes really you did the silent test coming but you saw sugar ketchup aioli coming really and ironically let us okay to stir fry in Chinese food you know yeah very delicious that's why my uncle Roger eats salad eat raw lettuce it's so sad cook that white people nacho cheese sauce oh awesome sauce yellow mustard wait how much sauce do you need on is it to mask the flavor of the bland food underneath it like sauce with a side of fried rice so you can't even see the rice anymore the rice disappear like submarine in the last week Uncle Roger realized I've become submarine expert now oh really yeah I go around everybody's a submarine expert now yeah don't use carbon fiber two weeks ago I thought you would know what carbon fiber is nacho cheese sauce awesome sauce yellow mustard sesame seeds pickle chips how do you eat it I use a spoon you're breaking the rules what rules are there exactly oh did he use the Chopstick from his hair I really

all cheeseburger all right the next bite of fried rice that not compliment that's just two different dishes yeah when you eat fried rice all flavor should work together imagine if you eat Thai green curry one bite tastes like Curry the other bite tastes like green nobody want that I don't think he likes it he's not even smiling he looks so confused he does look confused you picked the iconic aspects of both dishes and made them really sing what do you want make them sing what they singing funeral song is it I had such a big hit spot on it tastes like exactly what it's supposed to taste like what do you think it's supposed to taste like this guy's saying it like this dish exists in the wild delicious the dill pickle on the top just makes it authentic is it fried what how could be authentic if it don't exist oh yeah there's this dish full like you want to have a cheeseburger but your girlfriend wants to have fried rice like oh I'll put the two together kill two birds with one stone all right but they're killing me right now it's awesome I love the place and you got an open bar you got karaoke at night this place supposed to get rocking it gets weird it gets weird come on

Korean cooking New York time called her the YouTube Korean Julia ciao but who the hell is Julia ciao hi yeah she don't even have one egg fried rice recipe and yes Uncle Roger already cracked monkey Auntie title because every time Uncle Roger want to cook Korean dish I always use maangchi recipe it's the real deal [Music] hi everybody I'm still in Montauk today's recipe is seafood kimchi fried rice kimchi fried rice just like egg fire rice usually it's just whatever you have in fridge this Seafood here a bit fancy this is a one-part meal so let's start one pot meal good is our old convenient no need to wash so many dishes and share the shrimp good yes good technique inside is some intestine correct so on the back like this see the black can always stay away in your shrimp because shrimp Wayne just like Jamie Oliver full of [\u00a0__\u00a0] the vein this is the gods so remove this belly area I just give some slits put this prevent it from curling up after cooking like it is so that it's not going to shrunk when it's cooked anti-monchi is so good at preparing shrimp she my favorite prawn star I prepare six large shrimp and six six large scallops so let's six large shrimp and six large scallops that's too expensive anti-monkey Your Kimchi fire is gonna bankrupt Uncle Roger don't make cheap thing expensive you monkey not Salt Bay my kimchi every time I'm going to see that blue cloth it reminds me of my colonoscopy and my [\u00a0__\u00a0] get tense I brought my kimchi the kimchi sour taste kimchi correct kimchi fried rice you need sour kimchi and kimchi get more sour as it gets older just like my ex-wife Auntie Helen around the half cup like this good so to little square like that correct foreign but maybe this kimchi can be a bit wetter because you can use kimchi brine to give the fire rice flavor this kimchi just sour and dry it really like my ex-wife you know what not sour and dry Japanese snack because this video is sponsored by boxu Uncle Roger favorite Japanese snack box seriously every time they work with Uncle Roger I get so excited they work with family business all over Japan to deliver new team of authentic snack every month and this

got many virgin niece and nephews so just get this box for yourself click Link in description and use my code Uncle Roger to get 15 off your first box to order foreign why you show us cleaning chopping pot but this actually very important step kimchi on chopping pot it leaves the color and smell inside chopping pot so you have to wash it immediately otherwise your parents gonna smack you Asian parent they love their chopping pot more than they love their children my knife and my chopping board everywhere they have to follow me to cook if I'm lucky the place where I stay they have a really sharp knife but mostly knife is very dull dull dull so that's why as long as I decide to cook I need to bring my knife correct niece and nephew you ever stay in any Airbnb the lifestyle as [\u00a0__\u00a0] trying to cut with Airbnb knife is like trying to cut with potato useless down knife for tall people that's why every time you go in traveling bring your own life [\u00a0__\u00a0] the police eat your right to bear knife for kimchi fire rice that's the Asian Second Amendment garlic correct good smashing and onion onion onion optional because kimchi already strong flavor but it okay one green onion spring onion good in Korean cooking if in doubt just throw spring onion in there usually correct let's see the pan for you did Auntie monkey bring this gas stove with her oh so nice too much you should travel in her luggage got sharp knife gas stove that how you can tell she really love food she rather look like terrorists then use induction stove I will just add 2 tbsp vegetable oil vegetable oil good and add this garlic onion green onion green onion in a bit too early Auntie munchie and it's a bit weird to saute inside pot what do you just use saucepan keep stirring until real crispy and brown see brownish crispy oil okay while you're transferring to another pan now that weird so this is around one tablespoon I thought you say kimchi fried rice is one pot meal this is a one part meal but then you use two pot is this fried rice in open relationship or something let's add shrimp and scallop okay so using the second pot to make shrimp scallop them over but it look good they cook well look delicious with two or three minutes just you can see it like all this turned into opaque inside even shrimp that means they're cooked that could advice except for sushi never eat transparency food unless your hobby is [\u00a0__\u00a0] yourself [Music] what is this my auntie monkey cooking in field of giant green dildo sorry children and not the plate this anti-monchi definitely got cleaner just using so many dishes and pans I made rice this rice is made with one cup one cup short green rice three and a half cups rice I hope that left over rice anti-munchy but it kind of looks like fresh rice kimchi going correct stir-fry kimchi a bit good and then let's add rice and I will add around a quarter cup water wait what what no no what no no water anti-munchy no no water please unscreen you say oh kimchi Brian you definitely need kimchi brine not water hi uh this Jamie Oliver mistake Uncle Roger have to put my leg down from chair Auntie monkey Uncle Roger like you don't put water in your fried rice you're gonna get canceled like me okay of course we need to add the head no don't go chuchung and kimchi fried rice kochujang is fermented soybean paste that tastes don't go well with kimchi fire rice if you want to add extra seasoning maybe sugar because the sweetness good pairing with the sourness of kimchi and of course you can always use the cocaine of cooking MSG in Korea is known as tashita to add about maybe two tablespoons and correctly disappointed wow delicious stirring like this okay kimchi fried rice Korean food you don't need to walk toss you can just uh it a bit boring but Korean people don't really use walk no walk hey why so weak so weak so actually this is the kimchi bukumba even just by itself delicious she using my toast put in non-stick pan but the metal spoon never actually touched the pan so that's okay good I already added just a little bit soy sauce soy sauce optional because kimchi usually quite salty already but because the kimchi not much brine maybe that's why she need extra soy sauce and now let's plant all Seafood here wait you you plating Seafood like this this like paella there's not fire rice anymore and close the lid you close the lid hi yeah this is definitely paella anti-monchi I think you're making wrong dish I think you're not making seafood kimchi fried rice you're making seafood kimchi

uh get on TV a few times now you so white I'm making which is Korean barbecue bulgogi [Music] traditional and a kimchi pancake kimchi pancake good mushroom steamed rice mushroom rice nice sauces to go along with it our traditional Korean dish oh I know I know okay Bobby you gotta I think now she's making marinade for the bukoki Korean barbecue beef Korean barbecue ribeye that was using pear for traditional barbecue sauce perfect it's soy sauce onions garlic sesame oil and a little bit of fish sauce for marinade correct maybe don't eat fish sauce but I trust Auntie Esther if she said it could then eat good this is something that's outside of my wheelhouse and so I'm gonna grab some Asian ingredients and just give it a whirl I'm gonna grab some Asian ingredients and just give it a whirl grab some Asian ingredient and give it a whirl that what JB Hollywood do he rolled the Asian ingredients too much and create this nightmare egg fire rice my bounty of dishes will be a kimchi and halibut stew and I'm gonna serve it with Crispy rice a crushed cucumber and avocado salad shrimp and Squid pancake Korean Fried Chicken is very popular right now not of those dish are for two sub but Uncle Roger understand nephew poppy American maybe he don't know too much about Korean food all this on my own in 45 minutes [Music] if this is the last battle he's going out with stuff he really is I get my rice on I got the chicken rice but no rice cooker you [\u00a0__\u00a0] up the base of the stew some kimchi gojiang ginger and garlic that too little kimchi for kimchi stew why so weak nephew puppy you small you smell [Applause] noodles with and sugar and that imparts some flavor onto the noodles wait what what you cooking noodle just cook in water why you put soy sauce in your boiling water you just boil the noodle in water and then put soy sauce on it when it's done that method is so weird see even Auntie Esther fixed smiling at camera and then I'm cutting the peppers onions carrots onion carrot okay I what is Korean cooking no need work hey like this I don't want to stress you out to get it TV show you need to do fancy trick otherwise people get bought ah you ready a little holiday quiz here no yeah knowledge of holidays around they're cooking don't bother them hi uh nephew suit guy what you doing animal is not part of a holiday tradition the Christmas cat the Yuletide Yak or Donald Duck Donald Duck that way Uncle Roger don't watch TV anymore they just do [\u00a0__\u00a0] like this to feel time if Uncle Roger cooking and you annoy me with dumb questions like this Uncle Roger gonna smack you like Asian Keanu Reef Esther wrong right gift card yes get to the point oh yeah we're doing chapter which is uh what Leah's working on we have some peppers mushrooms onions carrots and then I have some calamari what do we what calamari well in the American is this or are they ingredient should be with beef calamari two Fusion then what I made a mushroom rice as well mushroom rice next I want to roast some mushrooms so I can top some of the ribeye but I also want to add some dried Takis and my Takis to the rice to kind of is that the same rice cooker see but now every time Uncle Roger make rice I'm gonna think of Auntie Esther ah Bobby I know you're busy give me a quickie okay I'm making a halibut stew with kimchi and Goji Jung halibut stew I'm using halibut because it's a meaty white fish so it's meat stand up to a lot of flavor you want to use fatty meat like pork because the fat from pork give the soup flavor but halibut is just white fish well I got flavor Your Kimchi is still gonna taste like water add some fish sauce some soy sauce and some sesame oil I got Korean fried chicken with Koji mayonnaise I mean who doesn't like mayonnaise and fried chicken so it's mayonnaise hi uh this dish so American it should come with sight of no health insurance next up I got the chicken dredge of all-purpose flour and cornstarch okay the batter for Korean Fried Chicken okay what else uh I got uh some crispy rice and I got um oh I got a crushed cucumber salad with some avocado and uh one person doing everything I was actually quite impressive you know so next I want to work on my sauces one is called samjangook Korean bean paste spicy oil green onion but what I do is I add some bacon get it crispy and add something like that and then bacon bacon not traditional but again this auntie Esther I think she know what she's doing add some of that fat and then the kimchi animal sauce is basically Mayo with kimchi a little bit of mirin and sesame oil animal sauce that it's just kimchi and Mayo Auntie Esther what is animal sauce is it like some In and Out Burger [\u00a0__\u00a0] Uncle Roger gonna say it in and out burger overrated yeah come at me West Coast people come at me same is this it why did sharing you found the pickle just for pickle I don't know I found it over there Uncle Roger showed them my pickle sorry children they find pickle and they look like they all see a ghost time for some crispy rice I have two cast iron pans the rice goes okay cast iron pan good choice it retained heat well because I am pan it's like white people what if you ever want to relate to white person just talk to them about cast iron pan they're gonna have story about how their grandma or great-grandma pass them down this one cast iron pan from generation and when you search cast iron pan on YouTube you're gonna see more video of people seasoning cast iron pan that actually cooking with it they obsess but cast iron pan is good cooking utensils so Uncle Roger approved this white people Obsession keep your culture alive white people adopt a cast iron pan today I'm gonna put the eggs in the top and the whole idea here is that the eggs not traditional but I guess it's okay over it I got some crispy rice and like he tried to make pancake I'm gonna try to make so my batter for my pancake is all-purpose flour rice flour some corn starch and egg and then some ice cold water good good ice cold water important fresh shrimp and Squid Esther is made and she putting spring onion on there very correct a cucumber and avocado salad how are you plating all this literally no idea [Laughter] uh avocado I'm not really sure if it's in Korean food no no it's not avocado not in Korean food please they need something a little fresh I'm dressing it with sesame oil rice wine vinegar and what he putting in there it's it's that cilantro that's not Korean either avocado and cilantro now nephew poppy trying to make it Mexican it smells amazing in here what's happening I'm doing cucumber kimchi cucumber kimchi good you slice it really thin salt correct you have to brine the Cucumber first season it with some chili flakes sesame oil sesame seeds a little bit of fish sauce of course Auntie s they're gonna nail this dish Auntie Esther so Korean her blood type is kimchi she can make kimchi with her eyes closed

messed up Ramen today she back making Vietnamese summer roll this dish one of the easiest Asian dish to make but she British chef so Uncle Roger have a feeling she couldn't mess it up [Music] my favorite food nice outfit you just like she planting into kitchen one about this rice paper at the table as a starter or just outside with drinks and you do need a couple of things some rice paper wraps yup recipe correct some rice vermicelli rice with me chili correct with me but wait wait wait wait the packaging don't look like rice with me Charlie and Nigella I think that might be Chilli I did this wonderful tangle of herbs and bits of cucumber which are Keys what is Auntie the other really fabulous thing about these is no cooking is needed whatsoever that's sort of correct summer roll the only cooking you need is the prawn or pork belly feeling so yes this dish not a lot of cooking mostly assembling summer roll is the Ikea of food a bit of soaking a bit of chopping then some rolling so is that right I mean it's like pasta rice flour rather than wheat flour really light and wonderful what this assistant looks so depressed it likes you fast to beat that did she get human trafficked into Nigella kitchen and a bit of water from Recently boiled Kettle or even less recently boiled a bit transparent I think in wrong Noodle and just drained and ready for use I mean you could eat them like that and they are good you can see why they're often called cellophane noodles okay cellophane is another term for monkey noodle for summer roll you want rice noodle not monkey noodle when it cooked noodle more transparent rice noodle more white but most importantly is the texture see rice noodle you just break patmong Bean noodle too chewy hard to break apart bouncing around when you're eating summer raw you're all gonna tangle like this High yeah also big announcement Uncle Roger and nephew Nigel we're gonna release the Haya comedy special on June 4th this is filmed during our world tour last year Uncle Roger even have my own special orange microphone for you stick around to end of video Uncle Roger gonna put trailer on there he just need to be drained now

Piper so coriander wait what why are you using scissor just pluck with finger use finger Nigella you're known for your elegant fingering remember remember your Ramen wejo and because it makes life easier I think you better inspect what I've done so far actually I'm not quite sure about these spring onions spring onions usually we use garlic chive but spring onion okay substitute should mix wait what what what what what a bit of dunking but you're mixing in both for put in the roll and roll it up what you're mixing in both you give white women some green leaf and they all turn it into salad ew look look at that mixture it's so Brown that why you don't put soy sauce in there some are all supposed to look so pretty bright color and everything where I got summer rolls so Brown when it come to Summerall white is ripe but don't repeat that anywhere else needs a nephew you're gonna get into trouble soggy glass noodle trench in fish sauce soy sauce vinegar How's that gonna be appetizing

whole family just weird it's fun with them got more eyebrows than you you [\u00a0__\u00a0] up Julius has been addicted to balloons for over five decades five decades started when he was a child to the shapes and colors now Julius has filled his home with over 50 000 balloons holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] buy them 50 000 balloon in your house this guy named Marie condo hi uh I love all balloons but I do have my favorites I like the crystal clear I've got the long ones the round ones but my favorite is the spherical ones why I don't know I guess it's like a guy that prefers blondes or brunettes you know I guess it's like a guy that prefers blondes or brunettes you know he's talking about them like it's some sort of sexual preference some people straight some people gay some people by this guy balloon this is so addicted he even has an entire room dedicated to balloons this is my balloon Sanctuary balloon sanctuary and this guy and his nephew and I don't know what this house got more of weird though or static electricity magenta purple yellow blue red and clear and okay stop listing all the color I don't have many colorblind people things showing off like there's a white one over there and then I got some orange at least he got good diversity in his balloon collection and yellow I try to alternate it to keep all the colors you know uh of the rainbow in there I sleep in my balloon room every night but julius's obsession with balloons goes beyond shapes and colors my love for balloons it's also a sexual love when I see uh my love for balloons it's also [Music] a beautiful balloon my heart starts to flutter and no no no no stop and that that music also it's also a sexual love when I see a beautiful balloon my heart starts to flutter Uncle Roger's so disgusted

ugh this like the PornHub version of up [Music] Luna is that shot for lunatic lots of people out there feel the same way as I do about below but there's two groups of the lunar group you got your poppers that get aroused by popping balloons and you got your non-poppers pop up non-pop of course I don't know which one was I guess papa is what's because you can't be sneaky about it imagine if you home alone and then you hear loud bang and then you go oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] is that gunshot or is that my neighbor coming [Music] I'm a non-popper julius's addiction to balloons started when he was hospitalized at just four years old since then the sound of a balloon popping devastates Julius and he even rescues balloons he believes to be in danger rescue I'll go to car dealerships and do what I call a balloon rescue when they set them out they're not rescued that's stealing early in the morning they're really beautiful and as the sun uh bakes on them they get really dull uh misshapen I feel you know like I give them a second chance at life oh Mike this guy delusional oh Uncle Roger want to know do the balloon love you back why you pick up life a balloon oh you blow me away are you looking for something with no string attached okay okay no more pan No More pan it's so lame I know but Julius doesn't share his extreme love for Balloons with many people the only people that know him is my family my wife thinks it's true but his what his he got what my wife thinks it's strange he got a wife holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] this guy got wife and Uncle Roger can't even get anti-ester to reply to my texts I uh this guy doing better than me in life emotional damage she accepted [Music] laughs she refused to participate yeah that because your wife a blow up doll that's the only kind of balloon you can touch the fact that he feels like he has to keep it a secret uh he's not keeping it secret there he telling the whole of TLC Channel hi yeah there's a a problem I see nothing wrong with loving balloons it's not hurting anybody dangerous and I have no desire to change today his nephew who's also an addiction counselor wants to confront the issue and convince judius to see a therapist I've heard through the family a little talk about your balloons not your balloon room what do you get out of your balloons emotionally when I inflate them it seems like they come to life for me really yeah I heard that there was a some physical attachment to these balloons maybe sexually they're sexual overtones to it sexual or understatement of the year you ever think that maybe there's something wrong nope yeah that's nothing do you think you'll ever give it up no no no definite no definite no hell I've been doing it too long this guy definitely loved balloon more than Uncle Roger love MSG I don't bring yeah wow is it does it cost a lot of money doing this no I don't think so uh there's people that spend more money uh buying guns yeah I guess balloon actually cheap date you don't have to buy them drink Uncle Roger stuck to eat this guy point now choose balloon or a woman you save so much money have you ever thought about going and and talking to somebody about it I don't have a problem right so why be concerned everybody's trying to make me think like I got a problem I don't yeah give it up these questions that I ask they're just strictly out of love I can't believe I saying this but Uncle Roger actually agree with balloon guy no need to go therapy hi uh he not hurting anyone just let him touch his balloon and I guess liking balloons still more acceptable than

his Ramen broth also now leave to simmer for four hours you can't rush this Jamie olive oil also cooked his egg for four to five minutes start by Soft boiling six large eggs for four to five minutes Uncle Roger don't think that long enough to still be wet look at this it looks so watery still he's a nephew seven minutes okay next time seven minutes oh no this is what happens when your eggs are on

it's still full of liquid this egg better than your wife sorry children sorry Lisa do you make your wife as wet as this four minute egg General never tells let me know are we gonna marinate it anyway we have to be faithful to the recipe Jamie olive oil always like to make his food healthy so in his Ramen he put spinach in there steamed some green spinach I don't need to teach you how to steam greens with the spinach bring it up super tight until you get a dead spot oh goodness oh where's the bowl all tastes like set so we're just creating 10 spot of set do you imagine if you do this in your ramen restaurant ringing spinach up no particular cabbage yet Uncle Roger in my whole life I never eat spinach in the form of ball cricket ball yeah what is this you're trying to hit people with

don't marinate it he just boils like this take out and serve no flavor oh dude it just boiled me who want to eat this sad falling off the bone hasn't got a bone this very sad chachu is one of Uncle Roger's favorite thing it should be brown beautiful and sexy good chashu should have same color as Ariana Grande now not Ariana Grande 10 years ago this chocolate was so white I think it's shot by Lululemon in his video Jamie Oliver also tried to chop his chashu when it's still hot that's not gonna work no fall apart and then he chop it this way yeah it's so weird usually we chop cha shoot this

round again [Music] hi uh okay this is the longest ring ever just jump forward okay do you know about editing don't need to show us your whole cooking in real time and we'll let that cook for a little bit about of probably about 10 minutes add some salty it's not good and some peppery pepper good for egg fire rice usually we use white pepper I'm pretty sure Kate just using normal black pepper but again this Cake cooking at least pepper it in the ballpark of the right ingredient s say to add some chicken chicken good for chicken fried rice hold on a minute okay that chick is already cooked yeah I know I know I shouldn't have but I did yeah I already cooked it actually correct okay because your pencil crowded already if you put raw chicken in there it's not gonna cook properly so I think Kay

remember niece and nephew Jamie Oliver put water in his egg fire rice and Kate do the same thing but but but Jamie Oliver put water in when the rice in there rice all gonna get soggy okay putting water in before the rice so at least the water have some time to evaporate which means K actually doing better than Jamie Oliver yeah yeah so it gives it more time to build up and did you keep to cook a bit more longer huh then he says now to drop the rice in rice [Music] okay this rice actually look possible big Improvement okay your eyes actually edible this time I know I know it looked like it come from packet rice but this is kiwi talking about the rice looking like this this big improvement from last two time not bad and then it says on the video to add sticky I wouldn't it can only do it

will slice right out but niece and nephew this is a good technique to master the pull out method do you do this a lot Uncle Google you have children I have three actually no so you're not very good at this I need more practice Yeah just leave it in too long that's the problem when you're in Miami always do pull out method child support very expensive oh my God but as you can see his bone is nice and clean does your bone come out nice and clean no no it gets stuck in there [Music] sorry children Uncle Roger trying to run family friendly chat this video is going to be good just having a blast with encourager that's how it's going to be review people you hate is the most fun thing I think saute like your Jamie Oliver what is this cut this is a porterhouse some of them are porterhouse which is with a bigger filet mignon and if the filet mignon is smaller then is a T-bone steak what are you trying to do I have no idea this makes no sense is he playing dominoes with the steak I think so oh oh boy here we go it's like YouTube tutorial for in sales what is this I didn't know Johnny Depp cook steak now I know right hi uh Hey Siri show me the loneliest person in the world hi yeah if you use stick to play Domino you need more friend oh no why what he wearing v-neck vest sunglasses he like combination of Topshop mannequin and Stevie Wonder when what is that on the butt of the Lamb what is that yeah I don't know some kind of vegetable foreign way to chop the animal yes he's doing it correctly to open it up it's basically just deboning the leg I mean he's a good butcher I gotta give him up here's he is removing the silver scan proper technique is just being fancy throwing [\u00a0__\u00a0] at cameraman it's just being fancy do you ever do that to your camera guy nephew Leon camera pen to him pen to him have you ever thrown [\u00a0__\u00a0] at him never did I ever no exactly he's paying you to say that so right now he's just trying to debone it Uncle Roger think I see this before oh yeah the Jeffrey Thomas show that's not a show I like to watch and I'm completely against it why are you against it because you only kill gay people is that why the show 2K for Uncle Google give me straight Show Top Gun give me Top Gun Top Gun memory take your movie that was a nice movie though yeah there are no gay people in there why you like it I have nothing against gay people on garage why she why he got Rachel of himself boxing and he even he can't even keep you know encourage your funny story I used to be a martial artist really yes for many years and I even had martial arts studio that was not impressive what you fight who you fight diabetes is it I'm fighting that now that was a good one that was a good one that was a good one that's what happens when you try to do a video together when car Roger you get roasted everybody he needs more flexibility he needs to be real fastest on his arms but it is what it is as long as you're exercising is a good thing what are you doing tenderizing his steak that's probably what it is do you do that also no you know it's a myth that a lot of people says that uh the wagy cows get massaged in Japan oh so it's a myth a myth it don't really happen it doesn't really happen it's not really true what only some very small small farmers do it but no longer anymore I think the small farmer do it not because they want the steak to taste better they do it because they're lonely and they can't touch their wife so they touch the car the salt base of egg fire rice at his restaurant I don't think so he serves wedge salad which which salad yeah and he charges forty dollars for it what is wedge salad it's basically an iceberg lettuce he cut it in four pieces put a little bit of ranch on top together with bacon and give it to you and charge you 40 bucks 40 bucks Uncle Roger never see someone so lonely he do fall play with his meat is he called Salt Bay because he dried all the woman up laughs but motion quite smooth yeah he knows how to cut meat but why he keep tapping the bot is that necessary not at all just littering yeah he's just littering you see that yeah and that was a little bit of meat there that was just a throwaway I don't like throwing any meat away you need to treat your meat with respect exactly no spanking the meat you don't spank your meat not my food meat the other meat I don't know oh my God that was so bad we're keeping that editor we're putting that in don't do that delete this that's terrible cool guy showing his true color yeah my wife's gonna kill me though [Music] that is not the only meat he's feeding her [Music] of course I think you're right what you're gonna do if Salt Bay feed your wife like this what are you gonna do and there will no longer be a Salt Bay in town this is what gold digger look like niece and nephew if you get woman to stop Bay restaurant and she enjoyed the experience just leave her it's not gonna turn out well oh no what he doing this time so this is a meat start he's trying to sell out the bone of the T-bone ah I hope he saw his arm hair off oh boy see how that that's a tip why did he go to kiss it what's this humping motion I don't know it's just also emotionless yeah Uncle Roger have seen Isis hostage video with more happiness than this so he's jumping up the tenderloin right here which is the tenderest uh part of the cow as you know doing now and this is hot butter clarified butter I actually tried this experiment it did not turn out good encourager is too much butter too much butter is not that great so he's just doing this to show off exactly why are you kissing the meat so he's just putting clarified butter right on top and notice that it's still completely raw oh gotta cook the meat man completely wrong I can still hear the cow moving the cow still enjoying the massage the happy ending you know happy ending oh yes very much so you ever have one don't tell your wife we're not going to tell your wife no comment happy ending the best only guy can get happy ending you know why why if a masseuse tried to give women happy ending it gonna take too long for them to finish they have to emotionally connect with the masseuse they have to know their fear and dream and Hope they have to see them like a friend first take too long like a couple tunnel that's a fact and garages that's a factor they're actually quite impressive you know yeah quite impressive not bad oh charcoal there you go finally you use something right nice I think you should cook food like salt Bay one thing you should try to recreate sope I've done quite a

Jamie Oliver fried rice it's not too bad what yeah not too bad not too bad now we add kasuri methi AKA fenugreek starting to smell so good this is Koya dehydrated milk reduced milk and that we added to the gravy to give the richness and the creaminess this is white person after one day in India see they get some sun they get a bit of color now we have to blend it for you what your plan to look like sex toy Uncle Roger remember this that why my wife leave me she got this [Music] [Music] just remind me of the magic wand you know the magic one the Hitachi no your wife no bend it until as smooth as this very nice restaurant Chef said I like what you do with the place yeah look at this this reminds me of my ex-wife she's so cold hearted her face turned blue Gymkhana Opening way back in 2013 and it takes inspiration from old British sports club in India ah that why all your art here is like see like people riding horses remind me of like Ralph Lauren this like Indian Ralph Lauren like Raji Floren this this good Indian restaurant is it good it is the best Indian restaurant I would say the best they paying you of course you say that [Music] before you prepare chicken you have to do full cavity search bend over a chef sit bend over how many fingers you want tell me I think Chef's it is a four finger kind of guy four finger so we got chicken leg that good but why you use chicken breasts Chef see chicken breast the worst try your time my ex-wife Uncle Roger don't like breasts so we're only gonna use chicken leg first put in the ginger garlic paste and just put the chicken in there please stop serving chicken breasts from now on you're ruining Uncle what's your reputation a bit of salt and then bit of MSG also a chili powder garam masala and kasuri methi chefs it do you make your own garam masala yes we make our own garam masala and garam masala something very different from every household in India every household has its own unique recipe you can get garam masala at any random British shop but it's not very good this one that we got from the local grocery store ew gonna eat that let's do taste tests of British garam masala versus Gymkhana garam masala Uncle Roger hand 30 Chef said can you sprinkle into my mouth [Music] no what about yours let's try yours oh yours more fragrant it is tastes fresher yes now we add hang yogurt why you call hang yogurt because we put the yogurt in a mustard cloth and hang it and let the extra water go away maybe my ex-wife would have stayed if Uncle Roger as well hung as this yogurt sorry children lemon juice yeah you massage the chicken well yes I'm gonna give this chicken happy ending you know what happy ending is you know happy ending only guy can get it you know why because if massage parlor give women happy anything gonna take too long they have to feel safe with the masseuse they have to connect with them emotionally they're not gonna come they're gonna take all day they're gonna have lunch break come back and continue we'll try to give a woman happy ending you're gonna get carpal tunnel and next mustard oil camera do you see this it reminds me of Uncle Roger's favorite website two girl one cup so Indian food is more complicated and we don't really want to taste the chicken a lot of flavors a lot of ingredients going in together and combining it very well good Asian food also we always have some sauce some nice thing for the chicken yes tasting chicken for poor people or somebody who's really sick now we leave this for two hours two hours later grab a skewer just slot it on 12 minutes in this Tanto this is like Indian people barbecue perfect place to hide dead body many many years ago in India the guy chopped off the lady and foreign did the lady taste delicious afterwards Uncle Roger learned how to work in professional kitchen before Uncle Joshua teach me [Music] behind [Music] put some oil in there Brown some garlic I think we need more I think we need more to Asian people garlic like your children they never enough now put in your muffin gravy don't waste use all of it taste the ingredient Jamie Oliver forget to make butter chicken without butter I put some sugar in there just use feeling [Music] some crushed consume imagine this your enemy now put the chicken tikka in there cover it with the nice gravy little extra sprinkle of my favorite white powder I thought Chef like white powder and Nigeria lost and never eat here she's eating with us really and she don't bring her white powder no hmm people can change you know what FSG stands for monosodium glutamate no make [\u00a0__\u00a0] good you say monosodium glutamate scare everybody off if you say make [\u00a0__\u00a0] good everybody wants to try [Music] coriander yes and then some chopped ginger spoon Jamie Oliver you so feel chili in this butter chicken remember niece and nephew use the right amount not the white amount the use of many chili to the people who eat here all your dishes all have a lot of food here is very spicy and Bully spiced but many Cora say chili make them [\u00a0__\u00a0] themselves that's double value for money that's true they can taste spice twice you eat spicy food for dinner next morning you get reminded of the spicy food good memory no other flavor like that you can eat ice cream the next morning on the toilet you're not gonna go oh salted caramel finish it off with some cream finish up with cream that is what happy ending is yes when you put your cream just your butter chicken yes chefs it too innocent this one [Music] how can I just feed you thank

Today, he making his version\nof green papaya salad. It not traditional Thai papaya salad, so we go easy on him. - Does give an amazing kick to the paste. - Wait, just one?\n- In. - No, no, just one chili? Gordon, how can just use one chili? Haiyaa. What in the Jamie Oliver is this? This weejio sponsored by ExpressVPN. Niece and Nephew, Uncle Roger recently\nfound movie on Netflix called \"Glass Onion\". At first, I thought a cooking show, but then after I watched to end, I find out this movie\nactually second movie, haiyaa, and the first movie, \"Knives\nOut\", not even on Netflix. Netflix always do this. They give different people different show. So sneaky. For example, they only have\none season of \"Demon Slayer\", but in India, they got three season, or my favorite movie, \"Everything, Everywhere, All\nat Once\", only in Turkey, but Uncle Roger use ExpressVPN\nfor more than three year now. I use it to change my location. So, Uncle Roger just\nsearch what Netflix country got \"Knives Out\", changed\nmy country to Germany, refresh Netflix and there is. This app so simple, just one big button, press it, and now you in different country. It more easy than Tinder, fuiyoh.

Som Tum is one of Uncle\nRoger's favorite dish. It's the only salad worth eating. Kale salad can fuck off. Oh yeah, Niece and Nephew,\nfor 7 million subscriber, Uncle Roger gonna make butter chicken. That weejio coming soon. - First off, these are\nlittle dried shrimp. (energetic music) - Dried shrimp, correct. - They smell almost sort of. - But that a bit much, Gordon. - For this salad, inspired by\nmy travels across Thailand, I'm starting by making a\nwonderfully spicy paste. - I like how he dress up as orange, but Gordon, just because\nyou dress like me, don't mean I'm gonna give you bonus point. - Spicy paste, little salt in there. - Salt, good. No, no, haiyaa. Gordon, pounding is in and out, not round and round. You not pounding, you rimming. - Little salt in there.\n(energetic music) In, just break them up. - Look at the pestle\nand mortar, it too new. It like it, never been pound before, just like Uncle Roger (sighs). Auntie Esther still haven't reply. - This paste is like a staple\ningredient in Thailand. That's what we're looking for, almost. It's like a powder. Right, next, just one clove of garlic. - Garlic, good. (knife chopping) - Slice up the garlic. - Nice chopping. - And get that into the pestle and mortar. Bird's-eye chili. - That actually good. - Powerful, but wow, it does give an amazing kick to the paste. - Wait, just one?\n- In. - No, no, just just one chili?. Gordon, how can just\nuse one chili, haiyaa. For Thai papaya salad, at\nleast use 5 to 10 chili. Just one chili? What in the Jamie Oliver is this? - Yeah! - Gordon. When you're making fried rice, you got two wok, you wok fuckboi, you have to be chili fuckboi, also. - A couple of tablespoons\nof brown caster sugar. - Sugar, okay, wait, that too much. - That softens the blow of the chili. - Wait, what? Soft, soften what? - That softens the blow of the chili. - Soft, soften blow of what? It just one chili, haiyaa, Gordon. Niece and Nephew, if\nyou need to soften blow of one chili, just give up. You not gonna succeed in life. You too weak (echoing). - Just to give that nice, sour taste. A little bit of hot water\ninto this, tamarind paste. - Tamarind correct. - It's a really tart, but sweet paste. - Good.\n- One Tablespoon, in. - No, no, you just put\nthe tamarind water in. Don't put whole tamarind in. There gonna be too much fiber in your salad dressing, just watch. - Fish sauce. - Fish sauce, good.\n- Now, it's got that. - Squid brand, fuiyoh. - Smell, slightly salty,\nbut the flavor is intense. Two tablespoons, in. Bring that together and\ngive it a really good mix. - More rimming. (pestle splatting) - Ugh, that sound. - Some lime juice.\n(energetic music) - Lime juice, okay. - Another touch of, sort of, tartness. The paste is nice and thick and fragrant. - No.\n- The heat. - Ugh, no. Papaya salad dressing not\nsupposed to look like that. Look at this photo. This proper type papaya salad. See the dressing, the\nliquid pooling at bottom Look so appetizing, but what is this, Gordon? What is this? This dressing thicker than Lizzo. How to eat? (energetic music)\n- The tartness, incredible. Green papaya. - Good papaya, of course. - Give a little peel. You can find green papaya\nin local Asian shops, and bigger supermarkets, and as it doesn't wilt,\nlike more delicate veg. - Gordon, the way you peeling papaya, you're wasting so much papaya. Just use peeler save money. We not rich like you, Gordon. Do you think papaya grow on tree? I mean, do you think money grow on tree? (typing) Hmm, okay. If Uncle Roger got that much money, I gonna waste papaya also. Actually, Uncle Roger surprised Gordon even peeling his own papaya. Gordon, with that much money you can hire little papaya slave, follow you around, peel papaya for you. - And as it doesn't wilt,\nlike more delicate veg, it's perfect for robust salads like this. Gonna grate it. - Grater, hmm. (papaya scraping on grater)\n- Look, that's what I want. - See if you use grater, the\nstrip not gonna be long enough. You want longer strip for papaya salad. More satisfying to eat. In pretentious French cooking\nterm, we say julienne, or if you hardcore Thai\nauntie, you can whack the knife on papaya like this to create thin strip, but Gordon can't do this. He's not hardcore Thai auntie. - These thin slivers. Next, a nice rich, sweet banana shallot. - Hmm. The shallot peeling technique? Perfection, but completely\nwrong ingredient, haiyaa. No shallot in papaya salad. I think Gordon use\nshallot just to show off. - Rich, sweet banana shallot.\n(shallot scraping on grater) - Who grate shallot? - Nice. - This kitchen too organized. Look at all the spice\nin the background there. No Asian kitchen as nice as this. Papaya salad just street food. We prepare on side of road. Sometime we even got hot Thai auntie pounding papaya salad on\nstreet, like this weejio here. Where is that? Uncle Roger need to go. That why Uncle Roger always say, Thailand got best street food. Look at this. Just have to make sure she actually woman. (upbeat music) - Sorry, children. - Nice. Some carrot. - Carrot, good. - Carrot gives it. - Oh Gordon, you have peeler. Okay, why don't you use it on papaya? (carrot scraping on grater) If your papaya salad look\nlike coleslaw, you fucked up. - That mixing. (energetic music) Finish that off with Thai basil. - Thai basil, wrong. - And fresh coriander. - Coriander, wrong also. - You can get Thai basil in good supermarkets and\nindependent Asian stores, but normal basil works well too. - No, don't put normal basil in. Oh no, that's not pesto. - Thai basil and fresh coriander. - Thai basil wrong also. Just because the ingredient\ngot the word Thai in it, don't mean it belong in every Thai dish. (energetic music) - Next prepare the crunchy topping. - But remember this Gordon\nversion of papaya salad, so, I guess it okay. - And toast some peanuts. - Peanut correct, good. - Chop the nuts. It gives a really nice crunch. In they go.\n(peanuts rattling) - Nice. - Roll them around the pan.\n(peanuts rattling) - Good.\n- It's off. - Gordon don't give shit\nabout peanut allergy people. - Now for the exciting part,\nI'm gonna dress the salad. - The dressing look too thick, too thick! That very western way of making salad, dressing and the vegetable, separate. (energetic music) See? And then he mix it all in. - A nice gentle sprinkling, roasted nuts. - Peanut, okay, but usually peanut is\npart of papaya salad, not just topping - Delicious, very fragrant,\nvery robust green papaya salad. So easy to make and\nguaranteed not to go limp. A perfect party salad. - Not to go limp? - And with. - What? Why you using that kind of word? Why your salad go limp? Uncle Roger want my salad to be limp? I don't want salad with boner. - A perfect party salad and\nwith such incredible colors, textures, and bold, exciting flavors. - What bold, exciting flavor? You see all the chili there? That the chili that belong\nin the salad, haiyaa. Where it got bold flavor? Your producer go out all the way to buy this Thai chili for you, Gordon, and then you don't use it, but I guess this Gordon\ninterpretation of Thai salad, So, overall okay. If it traditional, this papaya\nsalad missing snake bean, missing tomato and missing\nthe little, raw, salted crab that uncle Roger like, but I guess, Gordon, this your version. So, I guess it, okay, maybe\nadd some tomato in there. For traditional som tum, we just pound everything in\npestle and mortar, everything. We don't separate the dressing, from the papaya, from the vegetable. That a very white thing to do. Asian people, we not into\nsegregation like that. (gentle music) ", "- Hello, Uncle Nick. How you doing? - Aw. We are gonna be making,\nbecause we're in Boston, a lobster roll.\n- Urgh. This lobster still alive. It a bit scary. Look how big it is. Put my face next to it. See how big this, don't touch, Uncle Roger scared. Uncle Nick, you win Uncle title before because you make amazing pho. So today, let's see if you\ncan keep your Uncle title at end of this weejio. - I can lose my Uncle title? - Yeah! - You didn't tell me that when you came. - You have to show me your\nbest lobster roll recipe. Let's see how he do. Uncle Roger growing\nup, I don't have money, so I never eat lobster before. - We have lots of lobsters in Boston so it's much cheaper here. This, when they're hard,\nthese little pieces here, this is a boy, okay? - Ah!\n- This is a boy. - So a lobster boy got two penis. Uncle Roger really envy\nlobster now. They got two dick. (Uncle Nick laughs) They got one spare. - Oh my God.\n- One dick don't work that night, you got another one. - Second lobster right here. You look at those same little things, these are lighter, more like\nfeathers, this is a female. - Oh, female got dick also. - [Uncle Nick] When did\nanyone say this was a penis? - Oh, Uncle Roger just assume. - This last one here is a boy or a girl? - He don't want you to touch his penis. - (laughs) What?\n- You sexually assaulting this lobster. Uncle Nick the Harvey\nWeinstein of shellfish. - What? (laughs)\n(crew laughs) Is it a boy or girl? (Uncle Roger groans) Try to touch it.\n- No, it just the thing, (groans) okay. Uncle Roger guess it a girl, it a girl. Correct?\n- It is a girl. Yeah, you got it.\n- Ah. Uncle Roger guess that because\nthis lobster acting crazy. That why I know it a girl. - How have you not gotten in trouble saying this kind of thing? All right, to begin cooking,\nI'm gonna take off the bands. You have to be careful 'cause if you put your finger in there, he will take your finger off. (Uncle Roger groans) She.\n- She, yeah. Uncle Nick use the right pronoun. We have to ask them\nwhat pronoun they want. Maybe this lobster is they/them.\nDon't just misgender them. This 2022, Uncle Nick. Don't get canceled. - I'm gonna show you\nwhat this would be like if this was your finger, or something even worse, potentially. - Oh.\n- You ready? Put that in there. - Ooh.\n- Ooh! Wow. - Ooh.\n- Ooh! - Ooh.\n- Ooh! - This lobster like vegetable. Uncle Roger losing respect for it. Ooh! - That's gone. - Do you hear that-\n- Watch me try to pull it out. I can't.\n- Urgh. Niece and Nephew, this gonna be my last\nweejio with 10 finger. - All right, to begin, I always\nlike to put a cloth under it because I like to kill the lobster before I go ahead and steam it. It's the more humane thing to do. Okay? - But lobster don't have\ncentral nervous system. They don't feel pain. - You kill them between the eyes. You put the knife in and you crunch down. Bash it down and crunch through. (Uncle Roger sighs)\nBe careful. - Lobster, Uncle Roger sorry\nI have to do this to you. (lobster crunches)\n(Uncle Roger groans) I feel bad. Uncle Roger going to hell. He still moving. No! (Uncle Roger sighs) - What are you doing to it? You have to be more confident\nwhen you hold the knife. - The lobster got family. - And you really wanna\ncrunch right through so that he's done, 'kay? And now he's dead, okay?\n- Oh. No, he's still moving. - That's the nerves. That's\nthe nerves, but he's dead. - (sighs) Uncle Nick is killer. Uncle Roger bit scared now.\n(\"Psycho\" violin music) I filming with Jeffrey Dahmer Junior. - At this point, it is finally time to steam and cook the lobster,\nnow that you've killed it. Even though, I will say, you\nkilled it a little bit slower than I would have liked. - Urgh. - The good thing is he's not\ngonna feel anything anymore. - [Uncle Roger] He in a better place now. - He is a little bit too big for it.\n- Your saucepan. - I've been catching lobster\nsince I was a little kid. I have a kayak. I row out\nthere with my brothers. We pull all the traps up. I brought Manny out one day, my camera guy.\n- Ah. Is this family bonding activity? - Exactly. - When you're younger, your\ndad bring you to kill lobster. That like family activity. Let's drive a knife through animal head. Ah, that why people in Boston\nall fucked up like this? - You make it sound a\nlot worse than it is. - When I growing up,\nwhat I do with my dad, we just go cycling. Uncle Nick go on killing spree. (Uncle Nick chuckles) Oh, fuiyoh! Cookbook! Every YouTube chef got cookbook now. (Uncle Nick chuckles) What? Why empty? Why just cover? - The whole thing's a coloring book. - Coloring book? At least-\n- Yeah, you draw pictures of food. - This is for people to\nwrite their own recipe in it. Ah, genius. Genius. - I couldn't think of any on my own so I just left them all blank. - Uncle Roger like this. (upbeat funky music) - Do you know how to make brown butter? - No. Butter you just buy from shop. You not Amish. Don't need\nto make your own butter. - First things first, we're\ngonna open up this butter and go ahead and put it right in there. - [Uncle Roger] The whole thing? - I'm gonna go ahead\nand take some of my MSG. - MSG with my face on it! Fuiyoh! This is nice, Uncle Roger like. You know I coming so you do this? - No, I've had this for a couple years. I've had this since before I knew you. Okay, so go ahead and we'll\ntake a little bit of the MSG and sprinkle it into the butter, 'kay? - That not enough. That not enough. - Oh.\n- Oh, there a little spout. - Do the dial.\n- Do it. It'll come under. - Oh.\n- Oh. Shit. Oh shit. Oh shit, oh shit. - Go back, go back, go back. What are you doing? What are you doing? - What? Just putting MSG in there, what you mean? We sprinkle on the lobster. Enjoy, before you die, eat some MSG. This terrible design. Look\nat this, how you close it? How you stop this?\n- (laughs) What? - No, it's spilling too much now. Oh, oh. Oh no, it's just, shit.\nSo much white powder. - What are you doing? Don't waste all the MSG. - Oh no, sorry. Oh. Who design this shit? Haiyaa, look at this.\nLook at this, camera. Look, it so much white powder. This remind me of my Saturday. Know what I mean? (sniffs) - And I have a little extra secret for once the butter's there. This is milk powder, 'kay? - Milk powder?\n- I go ahead, I add a little bit of\nmilk powder in there. Now I wait until it gets nice\nand toasty and light brown, and then we pour it off into a bowl. Can you get me another bowl? - [Uncle Roger] Nice. Where? - The cabinet right there. - How you open this cabinet? Uncle Nick, why your cabinet cannot... Aah. So how you opened it, you just hit it? Aah. This is what Uncle Roger\nlike about cooking, violence. - That is perfect, perfect brown butter. So the next step, we have hotdog buns. I like to go ahead and trim off both sides of the hotdog bun, and\nthen I go in with some oil. - You just built whole studio kitchen and then you forgot to\nput stove on your island. Haiyaa. Why the stove there? You cooking YouTuber,\nstove should be here. - I did think Uncle Roger\nwould be happy to know that I have a nice wok. - Oh!\n- And it's very well seasoned, and I have a setup for my wok right here. - Nice, nice. But still, this thing\nshould be over there. Nick, your designer fucked up. - If Uncle Roger goes on a date, comes back with a nice lady\nand wakes up in the morning, do you make a nice breakfast? - No. I tie her down like\nhow I tied the lobster. (both chuckling) Since my ex-wife left, Uncle\nRoger don't focus on woman now. - I hate to break it to you, but you're definitely gonna burn this, Uncle Roger.\n- Oh, shit. You keep distracting Uncle\nRoger with your talking. Oh no. We do another one. Is this what you make\nwhen you bring woman back? Lobster roll for breakfast? - If they're lucky. - Okay. Don't let your\ngirlfriend find out. - Oh.\n- Mmm. (upbeat funky music) - [Uncle Nick] Mmm, mmm. - I thought you allergic-\n- You put way too much MSG. - No such thing as too much MSG. Ooh, it just right! - There's one more thing\nyou can do with a lobster, you can hypnotize it or put it to sleep. - How?\n- 'Kay, so this guy's alive, moving around-\n- You just let them watch one of your weejio. That how they sleep. - Emotional damage! - That's good. That's good.\n(Uncle Roger laughs) You flip him down and put him on his face, and then see how he's still moving? - Yeah. - We're gonna brush him between\nhis eyes for a little bit, right between his head, and\nthen he'll slowly relax. 'Kay. He's asleep. - Fuiyoh. Nice. - Well, now watch. Ready?\n- Okay. - [Uncle Nick] When you put him\nback down, he's alive again. - [Uncle Roger] Huh! - Isn't that crazy? - This lobster so stupid. Let's put it upside down,\nhe fall asleep. Haiyaa. Sometime Uncle Roger got\ninsomnia. Cannot sleep at night. I wish I was lobster, I just. There, I fall asleep like this. - [Uncle Nick] I'm gonna lift her out. - [Uncle Roger] Oh, whoa. Fuiyoh. - And into the ice bath we go. - Ah, nice.\n- And the lobster's so big that I can't even fit it in the ice bath. - Where you get this lobster from? - I have a guy that gives me seafood. So if I ask him for big\nlobster or small lobster, he gets whatever we need. - Nice.\n- Or I can ask him for all girls or I can\nask him for all boys. - So he like the human\ntrafficker for lobster. And then what is this room? - This is the guest bedroom. - Why you got bedroom in your studio? Is this where you film\nyour OnlyFan? Haiyaa. - I don't have an OnlyFans. - Really? - No. - This perfect for it.\nThe lighting good also. - What?\n(Zach laughs) My favorite movie in the\nworld, \"Ratatouille,\" and this is my motto, anyone can cook. - Are you sure anyone can cook? Have you seen Jamie Oliver? He the exception to\nthis statement, haiyaa. You should put except Jamie Oliver under there.\n(Uncle Nick laughs) More neon text under there.\n- Oh. Speaking of which, I actually, because you came to Boston,\nI have a gift for you. I kept it hidden in the drawer so that Uncle Roger wouldn't see it. - [Uncle Roger] What is that? - You ready?\n- Yeah. Oh no.\n- \"Jamie's 15 Minute Meals.\" - What is this shit? Haiyaa. Oh, and there is stuff inside. Jamie Oliver, his cookbook\nshould be empty, haiyaa. Thank you, Uncle Nick, but Uncle Roger not gonna\nbring this back with me. (upbeat funky music) - At this point, we need\nto take out all the meat. First things first,\ncrack off a claw, okay? Crack it and then go ahead and crack it open and pull that off. - Fuiyoh!\nThat's lots of lobster meat right there, 'kay? That right there is the whole\nlobster claw from inside. Isn't that beautiful? - Oh. Why it so hard to crack? I struck, oh, oh shit. Oh, there we go. - Twist, 'kay, now flip it\nover, do the other side. Good. Twist. Good. Now you can break it by- - Oh, squirting. Fuiyoh! Uncle Roger never seen this before. If I can't make woman\nsquirt, make lobster squirt, that a nice second place. It not perfect, but it okay. First time cooking lobster. - Not bad at all. All right, and the last\nthing I wanna show you is how to take off the tail, okay? Open it up. Twist. Again. - What the green thing? - [Uncle Nick] That's the poop. - Eww. - That's a lot of poop.\n- That's a lot of shit. - Yeah.\n- Remind me of you. Full of shit. - Now you can see I've\nslightly undercooked the meat on purpose so I can control\nthe finishing of it, okay? Oh, someone taught Uncle\nRoger knife work, huh? - What, you think I can't cook? Why you look down on me like that? Just because I don't\ncompete in \"MasterChef\" don't mean I cannot cook. Haiyaa.\n- I might be the one that's about to lose my title. Do you wanna try a piece? I'll feed you. What are you doing? Why are you\nclosing your eyes like that? (smooth sexy music)\n- Mmm. Mmm. The texture good. Many people overcook lobster and then it become very rubbery. - I'm gonna go ahead\nand take my brown butter that we made earlier and\nput that into the pan. Once that's lightly hot, I'm gonna go ahead toss in my lobster meat but we don't wanna overcook this. - Niece and Nephew, this not non-stick, so you can use metal in it. Don't worry. - This is how we finish\nthe lobster roll, 'kay? In with some mayonnaise. - Good American condiment. - It's actually not in my\ncookbook, but I do this, this is a little trick outside. I like to go ahead and\njust put some celery, just for texture. - Why it not in your cookbook? - I just forgot to put it in there. - See, Niece and Nephew,\nthat what you get, empty cookbook with mistake in them. Haiyaa. - Where's my microplane? You know what a microplane is? - Shredding cheese thing. - [Uncle Nick] You know so much\nmore than I thought you did. - What? Who you think I am? Jamie Oliver? Haiyaa. - [Uncle Nick] So I'm gonna go in with a little bit of this lemon zest. - That the only thing lemon good for. You ever tried to eat whole lemon? It tastes like shit. But\nlemon zest taste amazing. - Dill. Then we can go in\nwith some lobster meat. Go ahead and pick all\nthe good ones, right? - And the rest, you through them out. - Feed them to everybody\nelse that's helping us film. - Yeah, like your cameraman. Look at this shirt. Look at this shirt. Leave comment below who you\nthink pull it off better. Uncle Roger or Nephew Manny. - The most important\ningredient in my lobster roll, some of this brown butter. A bunch of this brown butter\nright into there, okay? Those are all the\nflavorful milk solid bits. Now we layer it all into the lobster roll. And then to finish things off, I like to add a little bit\nof these fennel fronds. - Mmm.\n- Okay? - Fuiyoh! Uncle Nick, this looks so good. Hmm.\n- I'm nervous. (bouncy synth music) - Mmm, the bread crunchy\nand sweet. Good texture. The lobster and the butter salty. Nice. Mmm. Mmm!\n- Mm. Very good. - Amazing. Uncle Roger can't stop eating this. This tastes so good, Uncle Roger decide you get\nto keep the Uncle title. Fuiyoh!\n- Yay! - Congratulation, Uncle Nick. To commemorate this, Uncle\nRoger got special gift for you. T-shirt with Uncle title. - Oh!\n- Fuiyoh! - I'm gonna hang this up in my studio. - Put next to all your\nworld record over there. And you can put it there\nuntil you lose it again. Because I know you're gonna fuck up soon. I have a good feeling. Niece and Nephew, go\nsubscribe to Uncle Nick. See you next time. Bye-bye. Oh, we actually in the process\nof filming another weejio but we're gonna pretend\nthis new weejio, you know? The magic of YouTube. Nobody\nshow you the behind the scene.

(crew member coughs) What's he doing? - He coughing. Have you heard of COVID?\nIt quite a big thing. - Here's how you finish\nthe lobster roll, okay? - Okay.\n- You have poop on your arm. - [Uncle Roger] Ugh!

move away from making Western cakes they always mess up high yeah and today we reveal Great British Bake Off Mexican week Uncle Roger don't have good feeling about this I don't have a good feeling about this either is this the first actually the first frame yeah minute zero oh my goodness take a deep breath Uncle Joshua it all gonna be okay hello viewer hello no are you excited for Mexican week I'm really excited although I don't feel like we should make Mexican jokes because people get upset oh no Mexican jokes at all I don't think so well not even one not even one oh my God there's no way you know how you know how many people this has to pass through to be approved to go on television television is a lot of work you got to go through barriers this is a British comedy they loved the pan so funny so humorous I dying laughing I did now you know I like I like dry humor this humor is is just try at my ex-wife while the Bakers practiced their signatures they haven't a clue what they'll be asked to make in today's Mexican technical Bakers it's time for your technical challenge so uh Paul any words of advice you've got to get your flavor combinations right and your textures yeah but that every food that every dish yeah you need to get flavor right and your texture right that's like when you get in the car you have to start it before you go yeah when you take a [\u00a0__\u00a0] you have to wipe yourself and then wash your hand useless information some people that's optional um depending on where you where you are remind me not to shake Uncle Josh on hand I didn't say I didn't I mean for your technical challenge Paul would like you to make eight Mexican tacos your Mexican taco be made yeah first off that's redundant Mexican tacos why would you Italian spaghetti it's also not baked oh this is going to be interesting Taco's new one on me this is my first time doing tacos I bet it's the same like you make tortillas tortillas yeah tortillas okay she just contested yeah yeah yeah she looks really scared though you see her like did you see her face she is [\u00a0__\u00a0] distressed British people making Mexican food I would be scared also yeah oh tacos for a technical it's Mexican wheat Pro it has to be tacos tell me about the fillings then you've got a picca de color which is basically you got pickled to gallo Justin pronouncing wrong it okay but hit the judge nobody telling him the research great choose your attack okay the most awkward eating oh the moon like she never eat taco before the instructions aren't really that detailed for each of the elements that just says make the pico de gallo make the refried beans the instruction really quite useless you say make the pico de gallo make the refried bean make the guacamole because they don't know the actual directions on how to do it they're just like we'll just figure it out I don't know just like buying a book called Running for tummy and that instruction go fast so the first bit is for the tortillas blend the drained corn until you have a smooth thick paste the planting corn no way fallen out onto a wax surface and add massive Arena then makes to form a dough Master harina I think it's like corn flour oh the nobody mixing corn with just make the tortillas So based off what it looked like they basically made Masa if it's the right corn and then added more masa that's dehydrated to it no [\u00a0__\u00a0] reason like getting Starbucks pasta and then they add flour to it I think it's gonna be sort of like a fig red like dough texture carbon least to stand I let it rest don't touch it let it rest yeah interesting there's no gluten so what are you resting like so it just relax a little bit so it has some some me time yeah don't need to let it rest this tortilla not the queen oh oh oh man it took me a second this British pick off need to use the British joke Uncle Roger you're brutal man to be arrested marinade the steak steak okay steaks would you eat that like that no I'm not really a rule what kind of question is that would you eat that like that it's a raw piece of meat do you go to the grocery store and just point at a package of meat would you eat it like that they have to fill time this hour-long show oh yeah that's right but no I do like his shirt you like his shirt do you know who this guy is no but the guy next to it was pretty attractive strong jawline don't fall in love with that guy look at the food sorry Kate that's my fiance oh they're a fiance does she know you look at Guy online where you meet Kate grinder are you on crying though she questions sometimes you know so the ingredients tell you what spices and herbs to use but they don't say how much ground cumin or small paprika dried oregano like a man human paprika oracano Ankara to think that too many different spices is supposed to be simple I mean I I guess for seasoning the meat a lot of the time it's like salt pepper and like a few spices in lime juice and you could call it a day but that's uh I am flinging things into a bowl with gay abandon ancho Chilito okay abandoned oh dangerous it's a British thing if you say that in America people will be really confused I understand the words it's just like for some reason when you say it in in like an American accent hey guys I'm gonna go down to the street and do something with gay abandon goodbye you know yeah we're gonna go who is Brandon who Benton and why is he k Uncle Josh I would like to have work with you Brandon you can be his side piece so ancho teleporter is dangerous ancho chili powder okay just like my actually it's not too hot I'm gonna sneeze it inside you can't really taste this why not that's pretty nice well it's meant to be hot anyway it's meant to be Mexican in it that does not sound good that sounds so derogatory She's Like It's Hot might as well be Mexican in it it's like the most English thing I could ever hear Uncle Joshua you need to do one video you speak English like this I'll do it for as long as I can until I'm tired of it oh it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] donkey Pico de galio oh my God this is the first time I've heard them I think Pico means small maybe yeah it's like a salsa just reading the ingredients it's not really like salsa it's more like relish so salsa you put on the side but pico de gallo you can put in the Taco pico de gallo Pico de galio what is it in it it's kinda not trying to do Mexican accent no no no no no no no no no here's the thing English people are usually white your last name mean white man also you already knew that yeah your favorite as he always tell me if it's not white it's not right correct I've never said that every day I've never said that I've been saying that to me the whole time oh I've never said that my brand is on the line here Nigel they are by yourself I think it's gorgeous I love Korean then cilantro I know people hate it apparently there's a gene that makes you taste coriander like soap it tastes like soap everybody's got them there it is I'm doing this to mine there's a soap guy nobody likes that guy yes nobody likes a soap guy a spicy soapy salty and sour great the refried beans the instructions said make the refried beans that the fake smile ever I don't understand what I don't understand that emotion take your smile you give when your boss trying to make joke and you hate your boss but you still have to smile that's what Ulysses does every day to me camera pen to him that is Joshua Weissman worker it's not that cook simmer and it will get soft oh my God he's got soup he's got soup going on that not Reef right he didn't even cook the onion those onions are dead ass raw the only reason that there's even the slightest amount of translucence in this because they're sitting in the hot broth I guarantee you when you bite into that it's a raw ass onion that's fixing a bit I am honestly never but again raw ass onion what I okay I forget that these are home Cooks though I'm I'm trying to be light it's just it's just bad refried bean this just Bean it's not even fried once Bean with like poorly chopped onions but you know I'm gonna start making my little Camellia guacamole oh how many apricots oh my goodness no [\u00a0__\u00a0] way she is peeling it like that absolutely not honestly Uncle Roger in my entire life I've never seen this in making all the Mexican ancestors that cry the peeling avocado like they're peeling Ginger boom boom chopped tomatoes are going in red onions jalapenos Red Onion usually Mexican we use white onions correct but usually oh chunk because Paul said it's about flavor and texture I like Paul said it's about flavor and texture in what world is that not important if you work at Jamie Oliver kitchen let's say avocado so let's smoke oh at least you know how to use avocado yeah this this one does she's she's used one before she a millennial they all love the avocado toast too bad they won't be able to buy a house are you looking for smooth and chunky that's the best way smooth and chunky why do you say it like that you're looking for a smooth and chunky that's the best way smooth and chunky that's the best way Uncle Josh I think turn on why did he say it like that he didn't have to say it like that he was he he was a smooth and chunky Uncle Joshua every video you make on your channel you always start with opening the cabinet correct yeah I thought you would come out the closet by now just finish finish that's what refried beans looks like what nothing actually yeah if you had no idea what refried beans look like then yeah that's exactly what they look like if you're blind then yes this white refried bean look like Bakers you have half an hour left make the tortillas divide the rest I don't want eight equal balls flatten using the lid just gonna go why don't they give them tortilla press tortilla press is like Mexican version of rice cooker everybody have one I have three they give them all all the fancy [\u00a0__\u00a0] the kitchen a the fancy fridge everything I can't give them tortilla press at this point I don't think there's a single importer in all of UK that Imports tortilla presses if you're Mexican don't move to UK that's what they're doing to your food yeah they are small but I guess tacos are supposed to be small bite size I think is the correct term bite size that's not what how big is your mouth that is not it was this big around she goes ah bite size perfect is she gonna unhinge her jaw like an anaconda and just she can fit a lot of big thing in her mouth don't underestimate that woman she's doing every man a service sorry children Matthias traditionally I think I mean to be cooked on a hot stone you just kind of go something that was good yeah that's how they're supposed to be you're supposed to like slap them in there in two minutes on each side I think two minutes on each side that too long is gonna dry out the tortilla oh it should be it should be like it should be second my 30 seconds look exactly but I do want some brown on there you don't want your titilla to be too dry not bad let's start as it's drying out oh my God come on does he usually he doesn't think that that's right I hope not that tortilla looked like the dried hands of a 75 year old man that tortilla look like Uncle Roger after my ex-wife leave that's some attack was done just need to make steak now [Music] medium rare first off okay so zero oil in the pan illegal to jail locked up no parole I don't know how to cook steak I will cook it like about five minutes each side everyone's got an opinion on steak and everyone thinks you've done it wrong no not not that's not true yes everyone has an opinion on steak but I think everyone's opinion on what's Happening Here should just be that this is wrong but Uncle Josh are it okay they bake her they're not supposed to know too much drastic go easy on them okay oh Mike so your sticks cook perfectly that's not perfect my steak's gonna be hot what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is that it's actually stir fries that's exactly what I was gonna say it's like stir frying without any of the frying or stirring just going to start assembling well just to be Fork full of each holy guacamole where to put the glockimolo no [\u00a0__\u00a0] way she just said that where to put the clock yeah where the [\u00a0__\u00a0] do I put the [\u00a0__\u00a0] guacamolo in it I've got cookie Merlot in it Bakers you have one minute left [Music] cheesy Stuff throw it [Music] no way they just they just they just hit two cultures right in the head Greek culture and Mexican culture are you for real Uncle Roger never have taco with feta cheese on each hour like what what the hell did someone get arrested at the end of this I have one more to go these are quite stuffed I legitimately think that they Googled an image of a taco and did their very best effort to just recreate it based off the visuals and did absolutely no research beyond that photograph I think I think they saw Cotija and they went oh something crumbly only feta I wish that we'd had like quantities oh [Laughter] she just took a fat dump on that taco there is absolutely no way it's basically I can think to use an avocado well that's um small Bakers your time is up bring your tacos down to the table and place them in front of your photograph oh wow it's so weird how they put picture in front it like they all die now it's like their memorial this is what's left of them I I have a lot of emotions on garage or I feel sad I feel scared I feel angry ah Great British pick off you have so much budget You're such popular show why don't you do little bit of research next time and remember don't dry out your tortillas don't peel your avocado needs a nephew go subscribe to Uncle Joshua

it's very very thin it Cooks quite quickly and then this one here I think we're gonna butter baste it and we're going to cook it on a cast iron skillet for some people that don't have a grill outside and then this one here this is going to be your ultimate Challenge since it has a lot of fat and marbling it's a Japanese Wagyu A5 New York strip whack you A5 yeah flares up quite a bit whenever you're cooking it okay okay we're gonna cook two steak and then the last one we're gonna burn Cuca House Down it okay you got home insurance cooker wait wait [Applause] wait he went hunting your nephew give you this yeah enough you don't love you hi yeah so here in Florida these are invasive species I don't know if they're gonna taste good I have never tried it we're gonna give it a try would you like to have some I think Google I think you're making too many video you're running out of wicho idea you're cooking reptile first up Uncle Roger we got to season the meat first with salt just use feeling now freshly ground black pepper you know a lot of people have the misconception that pepper Burns yeah it doesn't burn it actually did a whole experiment it takes about three minutes for the peppers to burn so if you sear the steak quickier than three minutes it would just give a nice roasty flavor have you seen Salt Bay it took this kind of random [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's true what do you think of sake do you like his restaurant and I went there I let's just say I'm not going back just say it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] hi uh he's not gonna sponsor your video just in South Salt Bay Subway you need to cut off your arm hair because he's doing this [\u00a0__\u00a0] and then have you seen how hairy is I know right the salt just catching in his hair I know [\u00a0__\u00a0] see Uncle Roger is so upset the pepper shaker dropped chocolate that's all good but I think we're missing one thing the king of flavor salt on crack MSG for you so much MSG yes and your honor do you know what MSG stands for Google no make [\u00a0__\u00a0] good don't be too generous just a nice good amount you know everything too much is not good you agree except for one thing money never enough that's true excellent job on Karachi now on these two I like to put a little bit of garlic powder while you use garlic powder and not real garlic because this tastes better than garlic powder on steaks if it's fresh garlic then you would the flavor one in hand so much [Music] all right thank you Uncle Roger you freaked out too easily that's true I I like to take my meat seriously you know do you put your meat a lot do you like beating your meat yeah nice quite a bit actually Uncle Roger too because I don't have woman in my life all right beat my meat every night yeah the more you beat the beat the better it is Let's Be I'll meet together come cook sure let's beat it needs a nephew check this out on PornHub [Music] how many knife you need I look at this camera look how many knives I'm a knife Enthusiast and courage I love it just say they sponsor you hi uh do you like Jamie Oliver I'm not familiar with Jamie Oliver so much you don't know Jamie Oliver I know him but I don't watch a lot of his stuff but I know that you don't like him very much yeah he keeps [\u00a0__\u00a0] up Asian food really he made all our ancestors cry I've heard he puts chili jam on rice don't even mention that Uncle Roger rather eat that listen how many oil you need avocado well you need different oils for cooking as you know on Courage I know you're an expert look at this extra virgin you don't need this just go to your editor room all the extra virgins editing your Ouija right now I don't even know how to react to that all right Uncle Roger I like to cook with charcoal here you control it on the top oh it's very dangerous this thing but we like danger right that's what you need to cook good food that's right the more danger the better potential for injury that's the secret ingredient see how it's turning white that's perfect now you move into a different corner going from black to white remind me of Michael Jackson oh boy but they like him he touched a few kids so what so what if you make album as good as trailer you get to touch five kids the uncle Roger root okay fine three kids three kids I had to leave this in and then cut to Google nothing that's fine payroll of Goo Gone nothing no no as if he agreeing with me if you make album as good as trailer you get to touch five kids that's true don't worry look there's a spider there why don't you kill the spider oh just like that gone where is move changing topic [Music] you're not blowing hard enough is that what you tell your wife all right so we got the grill ready nice and hot let's put the steak right in here but first see how it's super hot and the real grate is turning white let's do a quick spin grab it on this corner just quick spin so we have a nice fret oh that's good now put the steak right into that why you don't want to put on the white part because it will burn that's what a lot of people say that grill marks are good it's actually bad it's just burned but it's medium rare temperature 135 see how it's flaring up a little bit now we flip very nice oh almost ready spin it one more time let's put it on a colder part that's good so yeah place the steak right on top same plate same thing oh look at you uncle Roger like a pro Uncle Roger talk [\u00a0__\u00a0] a lot but I can cook also oh look at that color Uncle Roger so we're just trying right now to get a nice crust some people say never flipstick they're wrong they're wrong they're wrong yeah you got to flip it as many times as necessary we're gonna get the cover and now we're gonna cook it to temperature so all you got to do now is cover it up what's the temperature we need one three five all right you don't take it out one three five take it out one one three zero yes you take it out a little bit before Uncle Roger knows now we're just gonna let the steak rest this is my studio encourage where I make all of my videos do you beat your kids cooker because there's so many things you can beat them with no on garage you don't beat the kids don't beat kids no is that how you discipline them a nice strong talk they will listen to me when I talk to them this way there's no need for beating I live in America too long now you're turning into white people Google okay disappointing oh fridge fridge look at fridge you wanna see the fridge everybody wants to see your fridge I show it full of all type of meat in there correct yeah not really what the hell where's the bow yeah why you go vegetables those are herbs I gotta feel you know I love herbs I have all different kinds of herbs no you want to see meat yeah I got you Uncle Roger this is me at this look at this this is weak and worst nightmare all right encourage you for the next one is a little bit more challenging because we're going to use a cast iron skillet on the grill itself cast iron skillet white people walk okay put it on so first is the first layer of protection remind me of my colonoscopy and then we got the second layer of protection layer of protection what you think I'm gonna get this cast iron skillet pregnant or something why yeah safety is our number one priority I beat the SM Cliff high temperature oil this is avocado oil good good don't use olive oil for your stick no bad idea Jamie Oliver do that no he doesn't he love olive oil on everything oh sorry sorry are you okay no I'm okay I'm worried about you my chin okay machine okay okay good the Crown Jewel protect it this can handle a lot of heat don't worry children [Music] now we're getting the crust we want thyme butter and garlic right there and now we're gonna baste it [Music] now another thing you can do if you don't want to baste you can just like rotate the steak you see you just rotate back and forth as many times your motion's so fluid so smooth I have a little bit of experience since you like wagyo I have to show you something yes only while you're on Courage every type of wine you're ready to go look at this so much marbling on here for you how much this compartment costs uh more than myself you don't cost that much Google that's true if someone kidnap you the ransom won't be that high hello we've got Kuka do you have 50 dollars I think that's too much or I encourage you this is The Final Countdown this is not a good idea I must say this already because it's very difficult to pull off but if you can't pull off then it's better flavor oh no it's when the fat melts and it hits the fire then the fire is going to come all the way up to here this sounds dangerous it is dangerous are you sure you want to do this needs a nephew smack like now to give Uncle Roger the strength to do this it might be my last video I might die here it's okay because you signed the waiver if this is my last video Auntie Esther Uncle Roger love your cooking my last word good luck Uncle Roger I'm out spin see as soon as you put it not much happens you just wait Uncle Roger have bad feeling about this your stress can see the fire coming up now it's starting you see oh oh no oh yeah and you gotta wait what the fire extinguish we don't have one oh no time to flip no patience patience you look nervous yeah the fire too high too high I'm gonna just scared yeah and you better not that costs a lot of money don't mess it up no no no spin spin spin spin spin back put it back back okay it's gonna happen several times that was a new laugh so evil I gotta go eat a Salt Bay Restaurant Roger [\u00a0__\u00a0] about you trying to kill me no you like Flavor so this is the best way to cook for more flavor I like the flavor but I also like staying alive oh oh no come

yeah look oh that look at what is that mold than lemon the malty lemon something I want to breathe near honestly and you grab it with your hand High yeah don't roll that multi lemon you about to cook we got a bunch of leftover I'm guessing white rice good good it's Curry probably Curry who are you yeah I'm uh Andrew's assistant and a new producer here at the BCU this can look like if h m become a person and you know he producer because he's just sitting there not doing [\u00a0__\u00a0] this is just home cooking video why you need that director chair meatball fried rice sounds like an attack what about an Italian fried rice is that appropriation is that appropriate Italian fried rice yes okay so we got some leftover steamed wipers which after night in the fridge as you can see is very dry and desiccated making it perfect for stir fry yeah I know the rice dry stop fingering your eyes Jesus the rice one day oh not 16 year old stop fingering it let me get some carrots and celery carrot celery I'm gonna prep these vegetables very Italian mirepois status small pieces so here's the meatballs I think I'm gonna quarter of these and I need more sauce can I hit the pantry or is this fridge only what's the rules well let me see if I just have some Jarred tomato sauce okay I don't feel like making sauce right now do we even have tomatoes if you can use Pantry just get pasta I see pasta in there you're making all this Italian stuff but then chewing rice in it uh Uncle Roger don't think it's gonna be good so garlic lots of it we need garlic onion like listen onion for fried rice Uncle Roger prefer shallots but Italian style onion okay we must go inspect the Arabs Garden all right we still got some fresh basil left that not Garden that just flower pot on balcony High yeah don't lie about size that's such a typical guy thing to do Best of The Summer's basil but I need a base so oh we could do pine nuts pine nuts pine nut and basil you're just making pesto now just lots of basil and and pine nuts like that it is actually wait a minute no don't put pesto in your virus spread out the idea to make pesto because that's more oil based it won't make the rice stick together wait so you're using pesto because it's oil-based you know what else is oil-based oil just make your fried rice with oil pesto for what it's not really Italian Asian fusion it's more like just some random Italian pasta dish but instead of pasta he use rice salt and maybe half of this garlic salt garlic for pesto good so you start with the uh pine nuts and the garlic you want to make a paste kind not good you add the basil leaves and then you slow correct you put the hot ingredients first in pesto and mortar then the soft ingredients later okay got some pesto ready and now we're gonna make stir-fry out of them so here we go folks just do it Andy just get started just get going yeah you're not moving were you talking to yourself still not moving this guy got some mental problem this guy this guy need therapy he talking to himself and he thinks flower pot is Garden this Gandalf Nephew just having mental breakdown in front of camera I think what I'm gonna do is get it nice and hot I'm gonna fry the meatballs he go walk okay [Music] spread them out and see if we can get a little crisp on them nice tossing and I'm gonna I'm gonna fish these out okay and onions go in and then go in okay meaty oil I'm gonna blast these nine million subscribers to make sure these guys really get crisp so now it's hot okay I'm gonna add the tomatoes here and a few puppies don't make that sound my neighbor hearing that they're gonna think I'm watching some different type of video hi yeah that's not looking bad like that's not looking bad at all I kind of love it this looks pretty done I'm gonna kill the heat so I'm adding the pesto oh pesto in your rice the rice gonna be green I need some really good balsamic I need some really good balsamic vinegar balsamic what in the Jamie Oliver is this this not salad not too papish why you put that do you put that in because it looked like soy sauce because the same color is that why rice and balsamic vinegar that's not gonna taste good hi yeah the flavor not the right type of flavor to go together what the hell I think you're smoking too much [\u00a0__\u00a0] from your hot garden and I need some really good balsamic vinegar a little hint of it oh and he put so much question that it's there toss it around fast before it settles and finish with some chopped parsley that we're gonna say parsley in rice outside right now so this is chocolate varsley and basil I'm adding it right at the end so you know bracing herbs that don't get hit by the heat too hard save some for garnish voila see what I say about mental picture so I'm gonna try it I'm gonna do something crazy and try it of course you're gonna say it good it's really good see it's really good every food YouTuber do this even Cake cooking even Cake cooking do this the sun say it tastes good for once Uncle Roger wants to Seafood YouTuber eat their own food and then say oh this tastes like [\u00a0__\u00a0] [\u00a0__\u00a0] off everyone [\u00a0__\u00a0] off I gotta delete my YouTube channel now that way more truthful no way this green ass balsamic vinegar rice tastes good I really like that it needs acid what what acid acid no don't need acid you already on acid stop cooking nothing so we got the juice of probably a whole lemon I think Italian stir fry that doesn't look bad I can tell you some first-hand experience it doesn't taste bad and then to garnish a few more fresh herbs and a little more top egg yolk on top raw egg yolk s all right this this he just making beef tatano every technique Western then why you bought that with the rice just make pasta maybe experiment with drugs and different relationships fire rice the yolk supposed to mix in there it gives the rice good color good texture you just put like this oh meatball stir fry folks let's see what we're working with fire rice so simple dish remember egg fried rice three ingredient egg fry and rice [\u00a0__\u00a0] your pesto hi uh maybe you add meatball that okay but you adding all this random stuff to your fire rice you might as well make pesto pasta It's just gonna taste when you're eating fried rice but it tastes like basil it tastes like balsamic winning good ah it all works no it don't stop lying to people and it feels correct enough it don't feel correct what you feels weird eating with a sports all time using Chopstick cannot save this well you're just trying to tidy up car crash now let's let's get Nico's unbiased opinion oh it's his first month he's making h m nephew eat the rice you're gonna be honest with me it's so good of course he couldn't say it good you paying him he don't want to see Uncle Roger don't like this Italian fried rice but next month when in New York maybe we cook egg fried rice properly you can show me your health Garden how about that let's make YouTube video to get the nephew baby this guy looked like cross between hipster and Gandalf let's see how he's gonna do how do I say Gandalf in the Chinese accent yeah [Laughter] that rest drier than Andy Helen that great for egg fire rice but I think one day old 16 euros funnier than you said it's very pet of pedophile right I think you're smoking too much [\u00a0__\u00a0] from your hot Garden people know her implies weed right yeah great yeah oh really okay it's legal here yeah it's true ", "hmm [Music] ah what the hell who are you you've been talking a lot of [\u00a0__\u00a0] Uncle Roger our boss isn't happy who your boss Jamie Oliver oh no that guy hi yeah why you work for him well if you must know he pays very well and he gives us free lunches free lunches you eat Jamie Oliver food every day why are you in such a bad mood you have to go around kidnapping people ah shut up Uncle Roger We're Not Gonna Let You Go until you give Jamie his uncle title oh no we all know that not gonna happen but if I don't give Jamie Uncle Tito I'm gonna be left here to die what I gonna do I'm gonna make gavogato which is basically a supercharged salad what supercharged salad just daily Indonesian food no need to oversell this Jamie this is not your Tinder bio but this video good your boss finally not wearing checkered shirt good he got new wardrobe do you bring him shopping or something nephew kidnappers first what special dressing start with 120 grams of crunchy peanut butter a clove of garlic and the juice of two limes no no two lime wrong and also we don't use peanut butter for carto we deep fry whole peanut and then use that to make the sauce because peanut butter you get from shop here they're not roasted the flavor is not gonna be good high uh Uncle Roger do you want us to let you go or not fine I I guess peanut butter okay if if you in hurry and you want to make carto like if you're house burning down and you need to make katakado before it turns to crisp then you use peanut butter that okay and and I guess garlic okay also can you just say one nice thing about Jamie I trying nephew kidnapper I trying have you seen any of my video reviewing your boss you know how he [\u00a0__\u00a0] up Asian food every time he make all our ancestors cry you Asian also why are you working for him I can tell in underneath the face mask it's a young Asian boy you've got that lovely comforting sort of moorishness of the peanut butter and then you've got the lime that's really spanking the flavors up spanking spanking the flavors up don't spank this Jamie Oliver loves spanking everything now I need to spank it we want to get spanking give it a really good spanking spanking the flavor what you're gonna do next finger the mouth feel Rim the Umami and then we're balancing with more Indonesian flavors we've got um soy sauce completely wrong for gado gato that big mess stick Uncle Roger gonna put my leg down from chat but good thing my leg already down from chair I know he gonna [\u00a0__\u00a0] up high yeah if you don't say something nice about Jamie you're gonna be left here to die Uncle Roger do you understand me yeah but just because some dish Asian don't mean you need to put soy sauce is that a mistake many white people make about a tablespoon of fish sauce fish sauce fish sauce wrong also not for katokato paste Tamarind paste okay it's now and then 50 grams of palm sugar palm sugar good correct it's very important you know sweet and sour it's gonna be amazing I'll put a little Swig of olive oil in there all if what hi yeah oh Jamie olive oil strike back this Asian food how you put olive oil in there you're not making salad Jamie look at this significant epic look at this [\u00a0__\u00a0] look at what your boss doing Jamie olive oil olive oil for Asian food can you imagine olive oil mixing with the fish sauce mixing with the soy sauce you think it's gonna taste good or not I think you're right that looks pretty disgusting Uncle Roger yeah this is so stressful Uncle Roger need to take the expressvpn needs a nephew browsing the internet without expressvpn is like going to bathroom without closing the door

texture as it is about flavor and I'm gonna use tofu two ways tofu correct but there's a lot of people that don't understand tofu they think it's kind of like you know a meat substitute which is not it is in its own right beautiful there's a lot of people that don't understand tofu what's so hard to understand about tofu you just cook and eat it it's not hard to understand this tofu not woman a beautiful beautiful thing you can cook it and you can get some texture are using wrong type of tofu half this Japanese silken tofu that off and just slice it up just a little bit you need to deep fry

potato is that good your boss getting a few things right nephew kidnapper yeah yeah yeah yeah perfect for soaking up all the flavors of that dressing it doesn't have to be a specific size but kind of nice mouthful sort of pieces so don't make it too big now the raw stuff raw for me no no no variety everywhere you can really kind of make it your own depending on what's available in the markets you know classically you'd have a lot of the Indonesian cabbages cap is correct Bean shoots here you know you can pick this stuff being shoot good use your imagination orange tomato tomato correct we use astonish lovely red cabbage red cabbage okay I got some uh beet Roots beetroot no but I guess you want to make it fancy the color oh so nice why are he holding that beat look like he got them from Lord of the Ring he's gonna say my precious salads do not have to be boring so look at this tofu now it's still very soft in the middle and it's getting crispy on the sides okay okay let's do it let's

crushing prawn cracker in Indonesian katokato Jamie you don't crush prawn cracker the prawn cracker become like spoon for you to scoop out the vegetables scoop out the sauce don't crush prawn cracker like this raining on top and now it's time to toss the ghetto ghetto and this is kind of what it's all about really now guys like this this Western salad technique again we just mix the sauce and vegetables you will see people that don't eat any veg you will see them scoff veg on a new level why is sudden like my Tarantino movie right before you edit this [\u00a0__\u00a0] comfort food dish

it it's delicious and okay I guess if it really hot outside you can have nice cold salad with cold tomato cucumber and wait what what what what pop and bean for yourself it and it comes from can I thought you said hot summer day you want something cool and fresh pork and bean are you making salad or prison food one is your macaroni salad and why are you using bathroom towel for kitchen so let's start with bean salad first okay so here's the tip if you notice here on the can oh I have cut it and it's sinking in a little bit no don't do that there you go I've gotten rid of the lid now I drained all the juice oh and then you can see right here look at that there's that bad boy you know what that is that is the fat from pork and beans this is somehow gonna add flavor I have no idea but here we go ready launch run what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] don't just throw random [\u00a0__\u00a0] everywhere you don't have trash can is it dump in the bowl oh okay now I'm cutting a large onion onion onion for salad okay I'm gonna say one-fourth of it so let's get rid of the rest there you go oh that looks pretty good oh it it's onion chopper that's the most useless thing in kitchen just chop onion with knife High yeah it's not difficult nephew Jack you've got 20 knife sitting back there but you're still chopping onion with this this flashlight [Music] sorry children take take those onions put them right in there in the mix I do heaping tables no he'd be what no man two heaping tablespoons and you're gonna mix it in you're getting this in your set look at that oh the bean salad very thick and that's not peace that diarrhea what is this it's so gross it's just mayonnaise and canned Bean what in the American you say you want this for summer can you imagine you're having picnic on hot summer day and then someone break out the mayonnaise and bean salad hi yeah Uncle Roger gonna kill myself [\u00a0__\u00a0] your picnic it will even thicken more in the refrigerator so dick and More in refrigerator don't need to be thick this salad not lizzle mayonnaise and then you're gonna put in two capsules just posture it in there vinegar don't worry if you spill over a little bit no Devil's one oh two just you want to make salad dressing you make salad dressing separately then pour on your salad don't just mix all the [\u00a0__\u00a0] in oh two that's gonna put a little tang in there okay you're gonna mix I think by Tank he means diarrhea and you're gonna throw that in the refrigerator and it's gonna be great this is something you can make the night before and just pull it out the day out no no no no after seeing your cooking I think the only thing you should pull out is your dad from your mom so they don't give birth to you and make this [\u00a0__\u00a0] niece and nephew you really want Uncle Roger to suffer asking me to reveal this concentration camp food Uncle Roger has a feeling that's not even the worst video he make holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] this guy got 1700 video my God his latest reach a 13 hour ago holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] who giving him the confidence to keep making video oh my God so many you you just keep scrolling and scrolling it never ending and he's doing fundraiser who is this guy how to make money on YouTube how did he go from cooking show to suddenly like Finance YouTuber Jack Scott funny here and this is this guy been making video for so many years now let's see if there anything was garbage dude he's a nephew better smack like button now uncle Roger torturing myself for you [Music] foreign at least the intro slightly improved okay so this is another spur of the moment video and I'm gonna explain it to you in a minute it's kind of sick and gross sick and gross yeah that's the exact what you want to hear at this cooking video of that uh it's sponsored by Harry's Razors today what he goes right here he's right back because this guy got sponsor Uncle Roger working so hard on my YouTube and maybe once in a while expressvpn sponsor Uncle Roger oh my God Harry racer who you sponsoring these are all left over from other videos uh I pulled it all out so we got these sweet potatoes sweet potato turkey smoked turkey some leftover bacon that's on its way left over bacon the injected sirloin the smoke oh it's in here I'll show you all this sirloin steak when I did the smoking hot dog dogs on there I got an onion oh it's like ready to start oozing crap oozing I'm serious it's if I don't use this onion today it's going in the garbage everything should go in garbage now none of this it look fresh usually when people make cooking video they use freshest ingredient some Farm to Table [\u00a0__\u00a0] this kind of Farm to Table heat trash can to table but I gotta use it all so I don't want to waste any food so I called it garbage stew oh Chicago [\u00a0__\u00a0] stew I get it wasting food bad for environment so you use all the food attempted favorites too we've deemed the onion is no good there's stuff oozing out of it I don't want to ruin the dishes but you name your dish [\u00a0__\u00a0] too oh cut up all the hot dogs I don't know how I want the hot dog and stew I guess I'll do them into small pieces that weird ingredient it's like kind of like this have you ever had hot dogs too I know beef stew chicken stew but hot dog in stew cut up this turkey this is turkey breast right here turkey is too okay I want the meat off the and at least all his meat cooked before the dark meat get rid of the skin all right so the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take this lime so just take your hand and roll it lime sweet potato garlic he's just throwing random [\u00a0__\u00a0] in pot now the Rachel Ray way or you can just do this cut them smaller foreign no don't put your finger out like that you could have cut just like that oh okay that better better his foot's so terrible if he cut himself the blood actually make it taste better my crock pot was not big enough for all my leftover garbage in my fridge so I now have to go up my mom's old sauce pot I love you Mom thanks for leaving this to me is that the only thing your Mom leaves you you know you're not the favorite Child in family first thing we're gonna do is put in the meat it's all cut up bacon hot dog turkey and we got combination next the fresh vegetables go in already no no no no no no when you're making Western food this kind of vegetable the carrot the celery the onion they form the base of your dish it's called mirepoix but you can't just put vegetable in raw like this you have to saute them first caramelize them a little bit bring the sweetness out for better flavor don't just whack it in there like this I uh mirepoix is Western cooking basic you also don't know green beans the corn about what Uncle Roger expects we're not hot by the ways I think I setting my standard too high I should cut those up Uncle Roger always say cook with feeling but he's feeling all wrong little Cajun seasoning a beer the beer actually freshes ingredient in these two doesn't this look like it might fit in my crock pot doesn't it all right let's try the cool cat go back to the garage and go get it if it doesn't fit it's gonna be pretty dark who cow what pot you cook in garbage is still garbage oh no now you're ruining two pot instead of one yeah you're gonna do four hours on high or eight on low I'm gonna do four hours on high put it in for like 24 hours just burn the whole thing down Uncle Roger don't care anymore okay when you have about 15 minutes left I want you to take the lid off you ready to take a peek no take a peek there it is oh oh it's beautiful beautiful everything looks so uncooked still look at the hot dog just floating in there next to the clump of meat oh my God this is food kidnapper feed to victim instead of garbage too nephew check you should call this fitso soup there we go haha and then once you pulled it all out you can either snap a picture of it and then send it to me on Facebook on the show page please don't give him more fan engagement please [Music] oh yeah what Cajun flavor you like this and jalapenos oh oh yeah call him Leonardo DiCaprio he's so good at acting I

wicho some like fun racist [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh rabbits yeah rabbits oh rapid I think the right way to start is um we want to put in the meat first what meat is that this is this is also rabbit we're making the broth rapid meat broth I think that's interesting that was not the I think um this is the most [\u00a0__\u00a0] up cooking show ever it is we're gonna open late we're just gonna casually hold that open the noodle that's the most awkward opening Uncle Roger ever seen him help me open this Brian yeah thank you have you done this before nephew joji you're looking like alien who just learned how to open noodle packet hi yeah this is nice wait no don't go in already no yeah we were given some Ladle if you want to make broth you want to extract flavor from meat first your meat just in that 30 second where I got flavor flavor take time you just boiling meat now as well throw carp higher in there for all the flavor you get gravel why he's still holding the wrap grab one of these two perhaps I'm very aware that we're not supposed to use ladles and [\u00a0__\u00a0] for this I just can't find anything so no this walk it's not non-stick pan it's okay to use metal later for anyone are you gonna put the rabbits what are you gonna put the rabbit down well I mean like there's nowhere to put it I'm just it's like a big space right there I'm pretty sure what is this cooking show okay wait I mean like there's no seasoning yet okay now hold on young man hold on I think we can still just use one I think it'll just do the job for all of them yeah so just stop boom zop Zippity Doo dot Bap one flavor packet for three pack of instant noodle that's not enough flavor yeah the packet is instant noodle it's MSG so throw out the packet in there use my nephew joji you can't OD on MSG

esther i'm a professional chef and these are my 116 dollar ramen ingredients why when auntie esther filming my video she's so dirty but when she filmed with epicurus she's so professional look she even dressed like vikka what going on hi i'm daniel i'm a home cook and these are my 11 ramen ingredients the exchanging ingredient oh who this guy why he looked like muppet from sesame street hi yeah he did bird come to life and become real boy very familiar with this i got it ah maruchan ramen this classic instant ramen in america but niece and nephew up your instant ramen game like uncle roger i only eat into me or shin ramen tonkotsu ramen is a creamy pork bone ramen i had a really nice piece of pork belly that i was gonna roll along with soy sauce everything on it's in a different language of course it's a different language that food from japan when encouraged to buy pasta i don't want to see chinese word on it marin i've used this before to make like sushi rice i think dried kombu this feels like cardboard this is hard at least kombu just feels like cut pot jamie oliver food tastes like cupboard big difference emotional damage with daniel's recipe i have simpler ingredients we have instant ramen noodles eggs garlic ginger scallions soy sauce and sesame seeds and a rotisserie chicken this is like a nice gift but this rotisserie chicken looks like the saddest thing which walmart you get it from five major components that make a really great ramen it's the tare which is the seasoning flavor the broth the noodles the toppings and the aromatic oil mmm anti-esta she know everything about food she's the perfect woman i i don't know how to make noodles i'm scared about these noodles rose daniel how are you never made handmade noodles before is there any sort of tip side note every epicurus vijo they always call rosemary trout this perfect name for food consultant rosemary is seasoning trout is fish uncle roger gonna come up with asian version of that uncle roger gonna come and keep soy sauce tilapia make sure they grow up into food consultant all right time to get started on the ramen noodles i've got potassium carbonate and salt and i'm just going to throw into the water now i'm just going to add this to the flour slowly well nothing's exploded yet so that's that's a good sign what can explode i know this japanese video but you're making ramen not attacking pearl harbor how can explode all right yes this is i hope long enough i'm going to trim the ends off so it's nice and square i'm just going to cut it in half so it's a little bit more manageable for me no don't cut in half if you cut in half seat your noodle gonna be too short the slurping not satisfying there we go oh snap there's so many okay whoa look at that see it's too short you put him off you won't even notice it there and that's what my ex-wife said to me all the time also we're gonna focus more on auntie esther this home-cooked nephew don't know what he's doing so daniel just sent me this rotisserie chicken and there's actually a lot there let's see what anti-esther can do with this depressing rotisserie chicken so the first thing we're going to do pull off all the meat cook the chicken and separate the skin ah nice idea i think she's going to use the bone to make her broth bone is classic way to make ramen profit and then the chicken meat can be good topping and maybe chicken skin can turn into aroma oil very smart anti-ester i see what you're doing keep watching see if uncle roger correct we have three different parts of the chicken we have our chicken meat our skin and then the bones good good so this is the carcass you can see here i'm kind of separating and dismantling the carcass correct if you break bone more flame will come out to extract more flavor from the bones this is ready i'm just gonna add water to our stock uncle roger loves seeing the dead chicken in that pot food vegetarianist and nephew you missing out see with chicken you can make delicious broth like this just kill one don't be [\u00a0__\u00a0] just kill one chicken for aromatics for the broth we want to build as much flavor as possible so to the chicken we're just going to wait aromatic already that's a bit early add some of the scallion usually we only put aromatic in there after the broth boy for a few hours but maybe epicurus gift and time limit so encourager understand many western cooking show they book studio kitchen like this but then they only book few hour i don't know why maybe they know budget ginger we're just gonna give it a quick chop as well and i like to leave the skin ginger good because it's stocked same with garlic i'm just going to give it a nice pound auntie that's the pounding uncle what's your favorite thing to watch skin on throw it in the pot with the chicken and let this go for two hours on a rolling boil only two hours all right maybe a bit longer but like i said epicurus no budget pate is a seasoning liquid that goes into ramen and that's basically what gives the salt to your ramen and to really give this tare a great umami we're going to be using the chicken yes [Music] see auntie esther also love msg just like uncle roger that flavor packet in every pack of instant ramen that the msg makes [\u00a0__\u00a0] good that white auntie as the queen of flavor in the instant ramen noodles now this is like gold i love this stuff encore you love it too here to that we're going to add during garlic this will go five minutes make sure the seasoning packet is well incorporated extract some of that flavor from the garlic good good there we have it our beautiful tare we're going to be using the scallions the ginger and the garlic to make an aromatic oil so we're adding the oil and we're just going to turn this on medium-high heat okay let's go as we mince our ginger and garlic small pounds our ginger i'm peeling it with a spoon pure ginger with spoon good technique here is our beautiful aromatic oil and then this is our crispy topping that's going to give so much texture to this ramen so i am nice very smart idea so daniel sent me these eggs and instead of just cracking the egg in the broth we're going to be making onsen tamago oh onsen tomaco that is egg in hot spring bath very nice texture silky smooth egg it like the better version of egg benedict always choose onsen tomato egg benedict for uncultured people nobody just ordered egg benedict for the egg people only order egg benedict for the hollandaise sauce if you need sauce to make your egg good you [\u00a0__\u00a0] up but onsen tamago you can have it just by itself it's so delicious the reason why we're doing four cups of boiling to one cup of cold is because we want that sweet spot of the temperature of 167 then we're just gonna cover it and let this sit for 15 minutes and let's test one out let's see frustrating it does it's very exciting okay good there's one don't cut to my pet nephew i want to see anti-esta egg you see how the yolk is semi-set and then this this woman nailing everything except uncle roger let's see what my pet nephew getting up to in a couple hours look at that how nice does that look smells so good whatever i was smelling before this is completely ramped up it's like way more sweet way more savory oh and it just looks so dark and rich and thick dark and rich and thick that is your favorite type of woman so if you talk rich and thick slide into uncle roger dm while that's going i'm going to start cutting my braised pork belly it's like disrespectful how good that looks it's missing a little glaze on the outside you know gotta hit it with two oh no don't give this guy a torch somehow with this much eyebrow should not use flamethrower you're gonna burn them off higher i'm gonna flip these over and do the same thing the chashu too thick want to bite into this like that sliced thin uh sliced thin yeah broth has been going for about two hours you can see the carcass is broken down it's starting to thicken so we're going to strain it through a chinois nice a ladle to kind of push out all of that flavor squeeze it all out like how my ex-wife squeezed out all my money so we have our chicken skin nice we have our chicken meat we're going to fry the chicken skin good if you go to a japanese restaurant you can even just order the skin separately and that's correct the inspiration skin the best part so many health conscious people they don't eat chicken skin because they scare cholesterol high what's the point of living if you don't eat chicken skin you call it cholesterol uncle roger call it enjoying life you hear a little sizzle i think that's ready i love this idea i want to do this at my restaurant see that oil coming out you can put that in aroma oil anti ester hope she remember you know it's done when it kind of holds together like that remember that seasoning packet i'm just going to sprinkle it chicken skin msg haram this woman go above and beyond two msg packet for one dish that why uncle roger in love with her as soon as it cools it's like ultra ultra crispy and i can't resist i'm sorry but i gotta taste it [Music] nice crunch i think she really forget to use the oil from chicken skin one small mistake anti ester nobody perfect so daniel sent me sesame seeds and sesame seed good topping plain sesame seeds doesn't have that much flavor but once you toast it it changes completely correctly has a lot of oil always toast your sesame seed don't eat raw sesame seed you'll not baby but i have a scallion which we're just going to slice the restaurant we call this sexy scallions see uncle roger no sesame seeds that we toasted we're just going to grind it up into a powder our last two toppings are ready to go just cook our noodles and we're ready to assemble our ramen starting with our chicken some of our crispy mixture nice the crispy chicken skin next i'm going to do with the egg of course we have our scallions last but not least aromatic oil ah a small mistake there anti-ester plating order for ramen you start with tare and aroma oil and then you pour the broth in let the broth mix with the oil and the tare you're not supposed to use aroma oil like little drizzle over the ramen that looks awesome and this is my take on daniel's ramen recipe that looked pretty good for you this woman such amazing chef she can make two minute ramen in two hours what empty esther when she filming with me she's so dirty but when she filmed with epicurious she looks so innocent and why she dressed like vicar rosemary is seasoning and then trout is fish not bad encourage i'm gonna name my kids soy sauce [Music] uncle roger gonna name my kids soy sauce tilapia [Music] don't cut to my pet nephew i want to see auntie esther egg [Music] all right the ramen noodle saga continues what saga this ramen not star war this muppet nephew love talking [\u00a0__\u00a0] [Music] ", "[Music] in different locations today because we've got special guests here please welcome uncle adam leo hello hello uncle roger i reviewed adam leojo recently yangzhoufy rice and he didn't get uncle tito but then i go on his channel and he made me in young fire rice and that very good so now he is uncle adam leon i'm so proud good good you should be you should even god and don't have uncle tito so today we review this video uncle wong gang the most professional chef he making the dish you make you think he's gonna be better than you more than likely see uncle roger like uncle wang because he got sensible haircut what is this man bun and goldie what you trying to be high yeah trying to look like post malone but he looked more like post alone can't believe i'm getting roasted by a virgin in a orange polish virgin uncle roger pounding all the time i don't just pound thai green curry this is a good tip you can either add it when you are cooking the rice or like this when you're doing it afterwards and just rub it through it make the rice less sticky and it's glistening it's just like a forehead this is good start instead of happy ending uncle wang kang gives us happy beginning [Music] cucumber very fancy a very expensive ingredient very expensive [Music] jiangsu which is where yangzhou is i don't want to comment on wangang no comment but like feel free to comment on him this is what we're doing what do you think this video is we're not just watching you need to provide some value to our listener it's one gun everybody can [\u00a0__\u00a0] up don't worry see how he's chopping he's chopping so fast have you seen how you drop go watch uncle adam chopping it's slower than starbucks wi-fi [Music] i like the different ingredients he's using it shows that it's a very high-end fried rice when you're combining ingredients from the ocean the land and from the mountains together that's when you know it's like a high-end dish and nice chopping also yeah what i like about him he just say he chopping he don't say [\u00a0__\u00a0] like masato in french cooking you'd call that a massive one no pretentious the cotton blue [\u00a0__\u00a0] actually right now he's cutting a little bit more like a brood once do you go to cooking school no no the way you learn artists you went on wikipedia and you memorized memorize the cutting name for that yeah so he's choosing the ingredients based on the umami trying to get umami into the dish and then also the texture because the bamboo shoot's going to be a bit crunchy the sea cucumber a bit springy the chicken meaty and then that shredded texture of the dried scallops which is also providing the umami and then the peas are going to be a little bit of sweetness there yeah this one okay if you don't use msg motion so smooth very important step remember shrimp wayne is like jamie oliver full of [\u00a0__\u00a0] he's going to blanch the shrimp there so the starch swells up around the shrimp as it boils and actually preserves the moisture of the shrimp nice cracking one-handed it's always a fancy dish when you're using not the same number of egg whites and egg yolks because then you got to find something to do with the egg whites oh you just throw it up why do you think he's filtering with colander is to get the the albumin out of the white you never completely mix the yolk and the white so if you don't put it through a colander you might get some white spots uncle roger think colander for egg okay just don't use colander to what is he testing temperature with his finger this guy is machine for you this guy don't even give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about heat thermometer for [\u00a0__\u00a0] let me just finger my oil do you do this in your kitchen sometimes sometimes another tip if you touch something hot and then you want to get the temperature out of your fingers you hold your heel up because the earlobe has very few nerve endings and it can help you disperse the heat from your fingers so don't burn your fingers he making egg into little string that's so much skill yeah it's a very cool technique you actually also do it instead of into oil you can do it into sugar syrup and you make a lot of thai style sweets you know you see the golden thread sweets look nice [Music] that's so impressive look at this making little shred of egg it looks so good it like egg floss he making and ankara to love how much oil he you see he used this much oil to make egg ankle he's such a good chef cholesterol don't [\u00a0__\u00a0] with him look at that fire so satisfying this like some lot of the ring [\u00a0__\u00a0] this is where the ring is made when you add the shrimp into the water like that you have to keep it moving very quickly otherwise it's going to stick together because there's a lot of cornstarch there if the water is boiling really fast and you move it quite fast as well it will stay separate oil it's a lot of egg yeah you see how fast his cooking is he cooking like he's running late for train uncle roger like that but that's not your style of cooking your style of cooking like doing yoga it's like meditation i like i think cooking should be relaxing your customer all pissed off at you half an hour they're sitting there and you're just meditating in your kitchen if uncle adam filming this video it would look like this i like the different ingredients he's using land and mountains together on the umami trying to get umami to the texture because the bamboo you have restaurant no i don't know no restaurant no why you don't open restaurant why'd you scare off i don't think restaurant is a good thing i have three children so having a restaurant and three children is not really compatible always choose restaurant over children sell your children many people want to adopt a children asian correct that's the most popular model to be adopted they're very cute [Music] he put spring onion first thing hi i think you need to add spring onion twice personally i think you get more fragrance when you fry a little bit at the beginning and then add it later at the end for the freshness and the texture that's what i think you're gonna start wilting i think melting is okay wilting okay as long as you add some more at the end for a little bit of extra texture you like flaccid spring onion real thing i feel bad for your wife now wilting okay hi he could have added like uh hong lobo to this because why is that carrot carrot because when you're making balanced chinese food you want a mix of colors for something like this you would want more red in it that's my only criticism okay okay bankruptcy don't like vegetable so the less vegetable the better yeah see spring onion second time that's what i said too yeah but i need some to release the fragrance and then you add more towards the end for the extra text but he put it all at the end he didn't start with spring onion you know who started with spring onion jamie oliver seriously have you seen that ouija and we'll get them sizzling straight away you hear sizzling i hear my ancestors crying 20 million views you haven't seen i haven't seen it no but i like jackie oliver you like why i even here he put mango chutney in his butter chicken i yeah okay fair fair he used three chili for thai green curry that's very yeah yeah you still like him i like some of the things he does we cannot be friends little bit of soy sauce okay you see he adds against the side of the wok you always want to add to the side of the wok anything that has firstly alcohol because soy sauce is actually alcoholic it's about three percent alcohol so a little bit like uh mid-strength light beer if you add it directly to the rice you get one part of the rice there's so much soy sauce and the rest not enough so when you put it against the side of the wok and then toss into it you're going to get even distribution uncorrupted didn't know soy sauce called alcohol next on the bar clothes i just drink kikkoman uncle adam let's have a few drinks cheers cheers cheers [Laughter] oh nice tossing technique that's good technique what encourages like about this cooking video is it very focused on the food he barely showed his face not like some people we know just talking the whole time on his face the whole time your whole cooking video your face show more than your spring onion i feel like you need to explain to people why you're doing something before you do it your style very slow and sensual uncle wonka [Music] look nice looks good looks good we got the rice separate yeah nice color and look at the string of egg that's why

super fun i've posted a few videos of uncle roger roasting the crowd roasting the people who wear orange you can check them out in the stand up comedy playlist linked below as well so yeah these are the final days of hiya tour we're not doing any more it's too much traveling i'm tired encourages tired get tickets now to the final dates and hopefully see you on tour today we reveal nephew jeffy sarcarian making filipino adobo this dish has many variations everybody make it different way so it's hard to [\u00a0__\u00a0] up but this nephew jeffrey he wearing suit to make asian food hi uncle roger don't have good feeling about this i'm making a traditional dish of filipino adobo i can smell the spice though there's some chicken thigh in a bag very cool the people sitting down they're just getting ignored this is very important some low sodium soy sauce low sodium low sodium oh always uh why low sodium soy sauce is soy sauce with less flavor who want that high yeah don't be [\u00a0__\u00a0] buy regular soy sauce big men like you scare a little bit of sodium high always buy the low sodium oh always uh very inexpensive white vinegar vinegar correct maybe put more filipino people love vinegar top all the all the top silverware some brown sugar sugar some black pepper a good amount of black pepper okay usually we use pepper carbonaro habanero what he putting in there habanero habanero habanero don't even grow in philippines what you doing soup nephew usually filipino food not even spicy no need to put chili in there but if you want to put chili use filipino chili habanero oh habanero that's the weirdest reaction to chili habanero habanero habanero okay and we're going to mix this together massage it you went for it with that habanero by the way massage it and put it in the in the refrigerator not again overnight it really it gets better okay marinating okay and we're gonna strain the manure we're gonna reserve the marinade we're gonna keep this it's a lot of flavor okay good then we're gonna take a beautiful dutch oven we're gonna sear it skin side down get a really good color searing okay but that's optional and who making adobo in this fancy lacrosse sauce pan hi yeah you know how expensive this [\u00a0__\u00a0] is 270 pound it's too fancy just spending money on saucepans spending money on expensive suit what's the ingredient for adobo wrong why don't you spend money on filipino cookbook instead hi uh you can see the color that's happening here it just looks fantastic all right there's just so much flavor so when they get nicely crusted we're gonna take them out look knife put them on a dish look at all that look at that crust in the bottom of the pan and you want to keep that spin on it you need it it was beautiful about that skin it creates like a flavor protector an insulator from all that so to this this fat you keep here really nobody care about those two people they keep talking and he keep ignoring why they die are they still getting paid by food network to be ignored must be nice when uncle roger is still married to ex-wife auntie helen i get ignored for free this good life this one okay flavor protector an insulator from so to this this fat you keep here some onion no traditional otopo no onion this is going to be some garlic garlic correct a little salt and pepper but wait too much because wait wait that it that all the garlic you use you're just using what that two little nephew suit guy when uncle roger making adobo i use like 10 or 20 whole cloves of garlic just smush the whole clove and throw in pot nephew suit guy use the right amount not the white amount this is going to be some garlic for asian cooking garlic is like money it never enough just putting five slices in there don't tease us with your five little slices of garlic this guy treating garlic like truffle and we're gonna stir that just to pick up the flavor it doesn't have to get very brown because this is going to simmer for about 30 minutes see that it's not really it's cooked i just gathered all that stuff i'm going to do another gathering by deglazing with the marinade deglazing what what the glazing mean adding liquid to hot pan which allow all the caramelized bits stuck to the bottom to release oh so deglazing just mean using liquid to clean the pan then just say that no need to show off with your technical term life too short for this the cotton blue cooking school [\u00a0__\u00a0] deglazing does this guy also say he deglazing his toilet instead of flushing that stuff i'm going to do another gathering by deglazing with the marinade okay very important filipino cooking with adobo is bay leaves bay leaf correct no tutu little but you really need the flavor and just plain old-fashioned water water good i think that too much it's gonna be so watery later okay you're gonna put that chicken skin side up back in yeah cook in the sauce correct and we're gonna cook this adobo gonna be so bland oh it's great it's great it's great not enough garlic too watery not enough bay leaf it's so simple and you can make this and basically start to finish about 45 minutes but after you get this what so clap crap for what that watery ass [\u00a0__\u00a0] a toppo is the opposite of woman it can definitely be too wet oh god sorry children this crowd so easily impressed uncle roger need to get these people to come to my comedy show i have rice warm white rice with no seasoning very important because the warm white rice with no seasoning rice with no seasoning it just called rice that what we call plain rice in asia just rice no but they say rice with no seasoning hi when you're eating bread do you also say oh i eating bread with no spread no we just say we're eating bread it has all all the seasoning you need here right i want to see you react rice look okay the habanero is in there let's go a little that beautiful sauce on top that looks pretty darn good oh it looked okay some parsley what what what

version of egg fire rice and today we review MasterChef winner nephew Adam Leo making it man bun gold tea and expensive watch is he the Asian Joshua Wiseman and look at his kitchen it whiter than Hospital hi yeah how he gonna do let's see let's see he's a nephew Uncle Roger continuing my tour still got some ticket left for London Melbourne Bali Taipei Auckland and all this city in North America these final tour date we're not adding anymore so go get ticket now Link in description so you're probably wondering why you've never heard of young Joe fried rice if young Joe fried rice is the most famous fried rice in all of China well if you're Chinese you probably have but if not it's probably just cold fried rice and you're like Uncle Roger like this voice is all a kind of a permutation of young Joe fried rice these things Chinese Cleavers obviously hi your nephew add them just one Cleaver use for everything you get two for what and while your clay was so big and not about the size now if you add the how you use it hello aunties the important thing to know when you're making a good young dough style fried rice is that all the ingredients have to be cut really really well it's kind of a way for them to show off their knife work this all correct so far but why his kitchen so bright it looked like he in heaven am I watching Bruce Almighty or something while coming next spring onion or Morgan Freeman if the most colorful thing in the kitchen is you you [\u00a0__\u00a0] up but you can use any different types of ingredients that you might like I've got here some carrot it's good bring onion some garlic good no no no no garlic young dough fried rice is Chinese style fried rice no garlic garlic more for like Southeast Asian style fried rice like Indonesian style or Malaysian style like what Uncle Roger make small mistake small mistake it's bamboo shoot peas correct now this is Chinese killed ham Chinese restaurant probably just uses regular leg ham or even Cantonese roast pork or even Chinese sausage something like that which easier to get but if you can get your hands on Chinese cured ham like this one this guy really talked a lot full ingredient just say Chinese cure him they got a whole story for one ingredient also some cooked chicken giblets all of these ingredients as you cut them up and you bite into them in the rice it's about creating texture correct in the fried rice some prawns some shiitake nice nice prawn lash mushroom nice as well egg of course of course you have this rice important part let's see cold overnight in the fridge so it's got a chat correct correct oh one light left over rice not bad but this rice has actually been cooked in chicken stock it's not just of course nice chicken stock for Rice what's the water you might have to add a little extra flavor that might add some chicken powder in when they're frying the rice which is very very common maybe a pinch of MSG or something like that no no not pinch of MSG you want to use the whole fifth niece and nephew fisting okay if you come to MSG but if you can the traditional way of making that young Joe style fried rice is took the rice and chicken stock first we use leftover rice because we want rice to be a bit dry for egg fire rice but his leftover rice still look a bit sticky see it's still sticking to his hand Uncle Roger predict it might Clump up a little bit later maybe tossing gonna be difficult the rice for egg fire rice you want it to be drier than my ex-wife the labor intensive part I've got to chop up all these ingredients into about half centimeter dice in French cooking you'd call that a master what muscle what in French cooking you'd call that a massage I don't use French cooking term you're making Chinese style egg fried rice don't show off your little cotton blue [\u00a0__\u00a0] High yeah just say chop centimeter for all these ingredients the prawns I can probably leave a little bit bigger and this music form cubes is very important I mean chopping could but what is with this music this looks like music for charity video I feel like any moment now they're gonna be phone number coming up on screen telling you where to donate for the price of three dollar a month you too can help this Australian Chef get haircut make him look less homeless [Music] nice chopping technique an important part of the dish obviously is for everything to be cut to the same size he correct yangzhou fried rice every ingredient need to chop to same size that's why you chop it to size of the Pea because you cannot chop pee so make everything the same size as P then everything same size Uncle Roger big brain nice [Applause] foreign now you really do get a lot of flavor from this cured ham just you you know the Cantonese roast pork or even the luchong the Cantonese style sausages will give you a lot of flavor as well but it's still chopping ingredient that's gonna have a lot of depth and Umami to the dish because the seasoning how many minutes now come on there's no fire rice need to be fast stop talking so much that not slow motion that the actual speed of his chopping this guy's slower than Starbucks Wi-Fi well but it's important to have some kind of ingredient that's going to provide a lot of depth and Umami to the dish because the seasoning that goes into a fried rice is actually not very much at all there's no heavy sauce there's no no even soy sauce I'm just gonna season this okay no soy sauce no soy sauce actually okay for traditional Young fire rice but like he say make sure all your ingredients got good flavor otherwise your fire is going to be so plunged Jamie Oliver gonna serve it at his restaurant emotional damage the flavor of ingredients is what gives the dishes flavor all of these things combined together can give us a nice kind of Base the rice is going to go in with some of the egg sure a shot off his hand for what see even the camera guy get bought he starts focusing on random [\u00a0__\u00a0] and then the salt that Seasons it gives you the taste of the dish so maybe prosciutto if you wanted or even just some ham or he's still child's bringing sausage eggs next I just need to add good those up a little bit nice cracking a crack on flat surface nice Chopstick with good head over to the wok and finish it off what good good now there's actually two different traditional methods of making youngja fried rice they're either called Silver over gold or gold over silver correct Silver's the rice and the gold are the eggs in the silver over gold method you fry the eggs first and then put the rice on top of the eggs on the gold over silver you fry the rice then pour the eggs on top correct that two method my niece and nephew just use silver over gold cook the egg first go always Uncle Roger got no faith in you you know Uncle wankang you're gonna [\u00a0__\u00a0] it up the silver over gold method is much much much easier for home cooking for gold over silver when you're mixing raw eggs into rice you really had to be tossing that over very high heat otherwise you're just going to end up an omelette for the other one for the silver over gold you fry the eggs first until the eggs break down then the rice goes over the top let's get started so as with all what cooking starts with oh he finally finally finally stopped cooking video this guy takes so long he came up blue ball than Auntie Esther but the wok very nice the smoke coming out good heat I'm gonna add more oil when I fry the rice oh it's good for now we just want a bit of oil hold all of these other ingredients together aromatics first so the garlic no garlic no garlic remember no garlic for young tofai rice no spring onion too early too early enough you add them okay I know why you put spring onion in there now because the heat bring us bring onion flavor that correct but just put it in all your rice ready just put spring onion at the side of Wok the spring onion fall down touching the side of what that enough heat to bring out spring onion flavor you put so early you're gonna Wilt the next thing I want to add in is the cured pork because the fat will render into that oil and give us a lot of flavor okay correct the rest of the dish and my vegetables The Chopping very good see very even good job nephew Adam and the prunes and chicken prawn chicken good peas at the end okay and I'm just gonna season those tossing to salt okay that looks pretty good so I'll take that out and set that to one side see here see here this spring onion already wilting starting to turn yellow high yeah what I tell you it won't look good you know but the one yellow spring onion it looks like it got jaundice now a few walks looking a bit dirty at this point you can brush it out under the sink but actually no need to clean it more oil going in than in with the eggs okay good nice oil around it's going to start to break up nice stirring technique and as soon as I sort of get a little bit dry that Uncle Roger think that it may be a bit overcooked it's a bit too dry you want the egg a little bit wetter then it coat the rice better give the rice good yellow color don't let your egg fire rice be whiter than Elon Musk on holiday that's when we can put our rice in now the rice is going to start to absorb the oldest a little bit clumpy a lot of oil in now this is why you want day old rice the test is punching good use the back of your Wok tool to push the rice against the wok correct as it gets coated in the oil that's going to give us nice separate grains salt in because that's pretty much our only seasoning here and then the rest of our ingredients back in nice nice now stop tossing toss toss and that is you have to toss the rice and if you add them don't just use your spoon to scoop it I think because his rice not dry enough still a bit sticky so he cannot toss see what I tell you that Rice thickier than nephew Nigel sock origin of pretty much every fried rice you've ever eaten this is young Joe fried rice let's see let's see hmm the rice have no charring on there no walk hey and remember no garlic for young Joe fire rice and don't put your spring onion in so early when this video comes out Uncle Roger gonna be in Jakarta because remember Gordon Ramsay challenging Uncle Roger he said he'd go to Indonesia more time than me so now we're

uncle gotten tossed his fire rice in indonesia [Music] see full of flavor you just made my ancestors cry no i didn't you did i know some spice fall on floor but that means your floor now more flavorful than all of jamie oliver restaurant emotional damage starting to smell fake when done point to plate and then put into strainer western chefs sometimes forget to do this and it's actually easier when you do this so when you take it out you don't have to strain the whole pot we take white people [\u00a0__\u00a0] and make it better is that the whole theme of vietnamese food correct they you're so mean you're so mean to westerners you know who means french people who take over your country does that mean kuyo this is how you tea bag encourager subscribe to uncle roger only fan now we char onion and ginger uncle roger never see green fire before that's because this cook is broken don't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] about safety regulation this whole restaurant fire has an uncorroded like authentic vietnamese restaurant remember to char your ginger also same thing that's why you must use gas stove cannot use induction stove knees and nephew how to do this with induction so you just put on the black plastic high so not satisfying fell noodles means it's made in a specific shape so it's made for fun it's flat rice noodles next step you soak the noodle for 30 to 45 minutes auntie tui i like your restaurant decoration also why so many chantalia ambience um yeah you you don't know what romance is i don't know yeah you just skipped the dining the charming bits yeah we we efficient right foreplay is waste off no you're cheap look at your ceiling yeah why the floor on there we were expecting lots of australians to come ah funny you'd like that yeah did you get that camera very good yeah i know i know come for the first day for the joke [Music] time for the meat look at this i like you auntie tweet you hate vegan people also how many cow you kill how you make me confuse is it possible yes it is how it is using vegetables instead of a cow hi delicious vegan pulse delicious too so sad don't give them terrible ideas good side is it doesn't take eight hours to make vegan fur yeah because nobody wants to make weekend food we don't give a [\u00a0__\u00a0] we half assed it that will only take three hours we have bone marrow flank beef brisket on bone oxtail shin all this traditional fur ingredient but this is something special this your family secret correct lvk's signature so yes so it's a beef short rib it's a favorite cup of wine so i added that one seven years ago and you guys loved it trust me i've already tried before it's so good and like the beef talking to them hello hello this is beef thank you for killing me now we have to bring all the meat wash it and give it massage you don't want your broth to look cloudy throw them all into cold water salt professional squeeze the lemon and now you want to give the meat nice massage to give good massage i just imagine this is anti-ester poor esther yeah i've heard a pontiac i feel bad for her why you feel bad for her well i think you're probably parked outside her apartment and she doesn't know that what people who are in love do you buy binocular and they're standing bushes that's how you show love to people not a day i know you're married to your husband so long now he don't do this romantic gesture anymore now we go to next step of cleaning meat this time we clean the meat from inside using the hot water so you want to use the power of the water to push out all the gunk that's how you make clean broth it's actually a key [Music] stone scarce you professional skeptic you scare water hi yeah if you therapeutic to watch it hmm encourage you feel like i won with the this is like a spa isn't it it's like a lesson with a spa i don't know what kind of spa you're going to you have to handle meat and bone now when all those come out time to put the spice in so now push it make sure it gives in yeah i know that what my ex-wife always tell me sorry children i push it it always go in that's what you think remember the cha onion we have we peel the skin and then put it in your broth also and the ginger so the secret recipe for our family is the daikon now it's not traditional but actually my grandma uses this so that she believes that it clears the broth at the same time it's actually releasing sweetness people sometimes use a carrot to release sweetness but then it makes the broth quite orange anti tui i think you're forgetting one important spice what is it the king of flavor msg4 just for this time for you what you usually don't have msg no hi why everybody in vietnam used this but there's so much flavor in here already flavor is like money more always better [Music] oh

pot for broth and she got two frying pan hi uncle rotten never see anyone make fur with frying pan it's a vietnamese foe it only takes time pronouncing it wrong not faux fur i'm doing it with steak which is traditional what they do it in vietnam but you could do it with chicken you could do a bronze or tofu or whatever you like wait wait wait no cannot be whatever you like there are rules to this [\u00a0__\u00a0] um so any red meat uh nowadays and that's really so nice it's a lovely treat i'm the same as you felt actually i don't eat an awful lot of red meat anymore either do you holly this is white people favorite topic dietary restriction you ever hang out with your wife friend when you go get dinner that's all they talk about i cannot eat this i cannot eat that ah yeah that is white people culture cause lunch and dinner no i don't do i don't actually we don't either and i can't what's she doing with the beef retreat but what i will say is anybody is making it is she oiling the beef every once in a while i just crave it sometimes she putting salt pepper and oil on the steak no for fur you either cook the meat with the broth or you brace it in the pot is she gonna put this on frying pans and then um what are you laughing at nothing okay take your steak or any piece of meat out of the fridge about at least a half an hour before you're greasy she's gonna do what i think she's gonna do comes out of the fridge it's all tense like this and then when it's out hence your meat tents encourage your [\u00a0__\u00a0] tense i think you're gonna [\u00a0__\u00a0] up and get your pants no hot as you can not pan you can use a griddle pan at home sometimes but most people just have a frying pan so that's great oh no don't no you want that sizzled straight away you hear sizzling i hear my ancestor crying uncle roger's so upset i put my leg down from chair you don't see so stick like this this is fur not outback steakhouse hi you want that sizzle straight away making stick like this are you gonna pair it with french fry or something like stick and fry i think she's making asian fusion now she's fusing vietnamese with depression so one minute on each side and then don't turn it i'm always tempted to turn it and then season it then again when it goes season against the bra how many times you want to season your steak like four times now four season is name of hotel not recipe for fur and then on to the broth so this is like the heart of the yeah i've got you make that okay broth first thing she said that correct beef broth here you could use chicken you could vegetarian but then you don't show us how you make your broth you just come here with the finished broth but it's the most important thing show us oh i know why she can't make the prof because she got no pot see the props you just steal from vietnamese restaurant down the street you spend more time sizzling your steak than showing us how to make broth high yeah why like that and then put in i put in the teaspoon of sugar sugar correct to be honest at home most of the time i actually use honey because we have honey we have our own honey no don't use honey you psycho mostly honey in there and then i've got gorgeous fresh ginger to give it that little drink please no not like that ginger correct but first of all you need to char it first and you put ginger in fur broth as whole piece of ginger you don't mince your ginger and put in there now people eating your food they're gonna eat mouthful of minced ginger yeah who want that you need to roast your ginger and roast your onion if you forget to roast ginger and onion uncle roger gonna roast you and then starinis i also put in which gives that star in this correct crispy flavor which i love um i love it so much but if you didn't have that or you can't find it don't worry the ginger is important but you're just putting one who's gonna taste it sugar is important and i think everybody has a cinnamon stick and you only need to make me turn over my steak and this is how you want it you want it seared you want it crispy give it a little you want it seared you want it crispy no no no no no crispy steak no whenever you ever have fur with crispy beef in it no need to have crunch in there if your fur have crunch then you need to be punched that's what uncle roger say and then one minute on each side that's medium rare if you want it to be more well done two three minutes on each side which still doesn't take away from your minutes okay back to spices i also put in a few cloves in here clove okay and nam pla which is fish sauce fish sauce good but wait that's that much for the powerful you're putting too much fish sauce so little broth you poured that much in a horrible smell it's it's nice when it's in a dish oh yeah but fish sauce without being in the dish is a horrible sauce yeah you know i'm so used to smelling it what is that black liquid when it's in there what the hell did you just paul tell people you can't just pour mysterious black liquid on cooking show and don't tell what it is what is she spiking her fur with are you trying to poison us do you work for kgb or something uncle roger guessing that black liquid there is soy sauce and that wrong again and then onto the noodles over here so these are vietnamese rice noodles they're gorgeous okay noodles look correct you could use any noodles you want to no you cannot use you have to use specific fernuto the word have rules woman not just anything gold can we remove the word any from asian cooking noodle is not pasta you can't just change it out for another shake they're all made of different things for different dishes i've pre-soaked these freeze correct and hot water and then i'm going to pop them into the broth here not into broth don't make noodle infer broth your starch gonna dirty your broth simmer they'll soak up everything i mean i'm not um like when i'm at home i do i do genuinely cook every single night at home i really go to restaurants actually needs clothe deck i think you need to go out to restaurant more stop cooking at home if you bad at cooking stop cooking you're not getting better you're making same mistake at home over and over nobody tell you you [\u00a0__\u00a0] up go to restaurant see how they cook learn from them then you go home and cook please stop cooking go eat at restaurant before you go on tv um you don't need to know that take the noodle out now take it out eat when you're noodle pre-soaked already just cook it for two seconds three seconds max don't cook so long you're gonna get soggy hi uh you're gonna bring me out to a restaurant give me a break stop laughing for the weekend with my mommy stop chit chatting what was i talking about you were telling me about rice noodles harry taking you out take the noodle out encourage you know what it called immune boosting first soup now because the food's so toxic for your body your body gonna fight it now i don't always have these noodles sometimes i'll have like egg noodles or i'll have vermicelli noodles or whatever noodles i have and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter just pop them in and they all kind of take the same amount of time to cook it's usually did you just say every noodle take same time to cook what universe this woman live on so you think all this noodle they all take same time to cook this is the food version of thumb and thumb uncle roger haven't seen this upset since my ex-wife auntie helen left same amount of time to cook it's usually about food you can cook from a recipe at home or it's just all in your head never i never i'm always doing a clear out i like maybe you should start following recipe why are you so proud of yourself for [\u00a0__\u00a0] up i find it really exciting taking everything out from the fridge and everything from the season i've got some tomatoes i've got this like ready steady cook and then i let it rest just for a couple of minutes but because the stick resting more than all our vietnamese ancestor canali we were going straight forward that is what you wanted right do you like your steak like that too yeah no not if it infer i don't like it like that i want to put a steak in there totally yeah let's change the broth to what you're actually going to do so for example no froth here it's so yummy i used beef broth here what'd she just do what did she just do did you see that it's so yummy i use beef broth is she smelling the noodle to check if the noodle done this noodle not fruit smelling won't tell you [\u00a0__\u00a0] hi so i'm putting in my noodles my thingy and then i've sliced up my steak i remember no sorry for my finger put steak first then pop broth unbelievable you don't send the meat swimming because that's yours and then i'm dressing it all up so sometimes you put the chili into the broth but for this one chili okay i guess chili in it you want it to be lovely and fresh there's mint in there isn't that mint the mint is amazing and i've also got coriander okay if you don't have all three you could just use one of them whatever you'd like whatever you have even flat leaf parsley and what whatever you have even flat leaf parsley flat leaf parsley parsley oh my god did you just say parsley for fur all asian people hate you now she british and she devastate an entire group of people i think she's the margaret toucher of cooking she putting whatever she feels like how about you put mayonnaise and barbecue sauce in your fur also anything go correct i uh i mean this is monday you want this on lovely i don't want this on any day it feels good on many many laps exactly this will cool any anxiety pop the music off yeah i kill any anxiety correct because in making uncle roger want to kill myself if my life gone anxiety also gone lifehack what the hell ankara to just watch why this [\u00a0__\u00a0] on british national tv hi uh what is this show ph what the ph stand for pornhub because i think the people on there cook better than this [\u00a0__\u00a0] nice and nephew uncle roger currently in australia continuing my tour meeting so many cool creators here nephew nigel go eat malaysian food with charney on his vlog and he

dumpling brand xiao tsuji this is uncle roger's second best discovery here right after anti esther it actually even better because i can take this home with me so today uncle roger at soup dumping factory and this is the owner nephew caleb when uncle roger first tried your soup dumpling i so surprised because it frozen but it still tastes so good after you cook fuel so there's a misconception here that frozen dumplings just means it's bad but we've done a lot of work at xcj to make sure you steam it up at home it tastes exactly like uh i'm not going to name it or anything or any other dim sum restaurant are you so [\u00a0__\u00a0] [Music] pretentious dumpling shop 15 for tree dumpling who want to eat canada for that how much of dumpling about 80 cents you can throw this at your children if they don't listen to you it's almost free make sure your pan is boiling with water put it like this make sure they're a little bit apart and then put on the bowl and then 10 minutes now we wait for it to cook uncle you also like the texture of this dumpling it feels so good look at me just fondling just fondling you're pretty good at that yeah uncle roger do that every night in hotel are so lonely nephew kayla you married i am married your wife wanted your dumpling like this so we've been married for eight years so of course not three years all right 10 minutes and you get this at home it looks so good let's get some chopsticks i come all the way here to film you don't prepare it's a dumpling factory it's not a dim sum house so what if white people don't have this wood steamer so we sell this online as well and actually 50 percent of people decide to buy this as well yeah it's very smart you sell online because i think when white people go to chinatown grocery store they're too scared to fight this they scare people think they're cultural appropriation or something it's okay white people just take our culture uncle raj your favorite asian actress is scarlett johansson eating this have to be super careful the soup will squirt up good first step of making xiao long bao is to make dumpling skin you start with white powder no no no not the type of white powder hi yeah it's just regular flower don't snort it you dumb white powder into machine and then you just look at machine and wait think about your sad life why do the people you love always leave you [Music] and next step we make dumpling filling we are so much meat in here look at this this is weekend's worst nightmare flavor how you turn on it's a safety mechanism so you have to like have this close first it's to prevent fingers from getting in there you know how many that's something we so because of this uh trade secret mechanism we've got no fingers stuck to date really yeah no no no fingers i can promise you no fingers okay camera camera cut camera cut off camera the camera not rolling no fingers no fingers you sure yeah no fingers but it tastes so good i thought it is good it is if you lose a few children finger have you tried human fingers no no bats in here either no bad no bats people comment all the time are there bats in here we we don't put bats listen listen listen uncle roger work too hard somebody please eat another bat we put the whole world on holiday for two more year there you go oh they're spinning yeah is this what they call meat spin needs a nephew go google meat spin thank me later what if i open this then it pauses yeah that's how you prevent the fingers because i have to show cameras what's happening can we trick the machine to think it it close 12 seconds later see life hack encourage your broad magnet you cheat the system see that's how you get the fingers in yeah put the finger in soy sauce vinegar salt and white pepper and some mystery msg yes some msg in there so little isn't that not enough [Music] that too little msg nephew caleb uncle roger need more my king of flavor msg [Music] some extra flavor in there nice we've finished our dough we finished our meat with extra msg the special uncle roger formula and now we're gonna form our dumplings this this this this this this ceo don't know [\u00a0__\u00a0] you need to ask all his co-workers hi how

chlamydia i'll begin by squeezing a few lemons into lemon already toss in the lemon halves too next we'll fill our pot with cold water it's time to add in our meat for the bones and meat we want marrow rich beef bones such as wrinkles or leg bones we'll add in some beautiful ox tail some weight just short rib a giant piece of flank steak and a little piece of brisket to finish this off we'll add a nice handful of salt give it a nice why when nick putting spice in always this weird hand motion hi professional chef so busy in kitchen no time for elegant fingering just troll when you're a great chef you don't measure things we just throw get a nice stir and let it soak for one hour we'll discard our lemon halves and bring the pot to high heat boiling the bones and meat for five minutes wait this just boiling to clean the meat you don't need to put lemon just yet lemon come later because now the meat gonna be little bit sour from lemon now we'll rinse our beef off in this cold water and as you can see we've gotten tons of that gunkiness and dirty good good good for me trust me i've worked for good meat and good cleaning also so now we'll rinse out our pot now onto a sheet tray we'll add some paper towels then place down our beef and bones to dry now we'll put into our pot with fresh water we'll add back that parboiled meat nice this on the highest heat the broth gonna be nice and clean this time good job nick good good job possible for three to four minutes this is where we're gonna see lots of impurities come to the top looking nice remove the gunk from the top until the top of our pot looks nice and clear now we reduce the low and partially cover for three hours while we wait we'll prepare ah your cameraman's sneezing because he's allergic to your well we wait we'll prepare our vegetables to start radishes my vegetables in nikon not traditional but okay pieces so for this i'll just do a nice rough chop for our onions i'll peel away all of our charred bits nice these will make for correct correct keep it clean and last but not least with our ginger i'll simply take a spoon and peel off that charred outside layer once this has been simmering for three hours i'll add in my charred but peeled onions see that's the same reaction when uncle roger catch my ex-wife cheating on me i just don't want to get splashed on and i don't want to overpower with ginger so i'll break this in half and add in some ginger maybe just a little bit more and then a few nice hunks of my dad is he using feelings with more salt and then we'll add just a bit of this beautiful rock sugar correct directly into my sugar correct but great for what the whole lump gonna dissolve in broth anyway hi yeah this is not pasta are you not grating cheese no need so fancy again we can adjust all our seasonings to our liking later now we'll simmer this for another two hours after quite a long period of time we can remove those we can remove those veggies and it's time to tea bag you can add some fish sauce if you'd like as well and we'll cook this yet wait what what he say what he's saying you can add some fish sauce if you'd like as well no no no fish sauce not optional nephew nick i hope you use fish sauce not optional so without fish sauce it like gordon ramsay without swearing something missing and this good time to put msg in there also you just buy msg from store why you don't use why again for three more hours what now he like tallest thought elon musk while we wait for our broth it's time to soak our noodles quite simply we add our rice noodles too and let them sit for about 30 to 45 minutes after all right hours when it's literally getting dark outside that's the sun's still up time our fall broth is complete and fuzz all about the bra so i'm going to have my cameraman manny who has never tried photo in his life come and taste all right let's try this it's really hot oh so that manny blow on this that's really good why his hair cut like this it like the hair on side of his head run away and meeting on his chin i think his papa  up we'll remove our sachet as well as all of our meat and bones our meat is soft and tender to the point that the bone should slide right out the bone should slide right out ah good good sliding my phone right up that also uncle roger favorite bedroom activity sorry children and hello aunties now it's time for our noodles for some reason mine says helen on it and i was headless roger talking about someone named auntie help auntie helen that my ex-wife is that her new business venture of course she making call until now this  left torturing me oh my god she's draining rice with colander once my noodles have soaked i actually like to cook them in the broth itself i don't know you don't cook noodle in the broth i actually like to cook them in the broth itself you cook noodle in water separately what you doing nick why you do that my thought is this why dilute your pho with a bunch of water if you've worked so long and so hard to achieve such an amazing flavorful broth by cooking the noodles in the broth you'll soak up some of that flavor it makes for a more delicious and powerful pho experience no no no no i know you just washed noodle with water but starch in noodle only come out when the heat so when you cook noodle improv the noodle starch gonna come out and enter the broth it's gonna make the prof cloudy you should know this nephew nick why so lazy start fresh batch of water and boil noodle in there we'll make a few nice slices of our beautiful it looks good soft and tender almost like the juicy briskets i always make and then it's time to assemble on one side we'll go in with our beautiful rice noodles and on the other side some lightly blanched beef nice look good with some beautiful thinly sliced beef also correct the thin sliced beef eat raw correct because we use the broth to cook it later add in a few slices of this juicy flank steak nice now to finish things off i'll strain my broth into the bowl at this step usually you don't need straining the broth should already be cleaned and when you strain broth sometimes it lose heat and you need heat to cook the raw meat small mistake i'll finish it off with a few nice leaves of thai basil pastel good juice of lime i like lime good and then in a bowl off to the side i'll add some hoisin sauce as well as a nice good sriracha this is for dipping our meat in but don't add it to the broth you've worked too hard for this for your nephew nick know about this give yourself a pat on the back because you perfect not bad not bad it just looked a little bit starchy from the noodle but very good so big improvement from his dirty ramen broth nick broth used to be dirtier than nephew nigel dm this actually really good missing spring onion and coriander in the end and some small mistake here and there but he the first chef i reveal who make the whole fur broth from scratch ah he got help from tui auntie

okay so today we are making a thai green curry but not just a thai green curd then you're gonna make your own curry paste from scratch in a mortar and pestle by hand yeah good takes time good good good keep making green curry paste from scratch that good because in western country very hard to get good green curry paste like when uncle roger make my thai green curry i make my own paste also but if niece and nephew live in thailand okay to buy curry paste from shop because take a secret recipe passed down by generation or even better kidnap random thai auntie ask her make green curry paste for you because good green curry worth kidnapping someone for so start by combining two teaspoons or four grams of coriander seeds one teaspoon coriander seed correct cumin correct or three grams of white peppercorns correct peppercorn correct into an oven that's been pre-heated to 320. yeah i went for what just toast in pan uncle joshua asian people we just use our one as storage for pot and pan until lightly toasted you could also do this in a pan if you want then let this cool oh okay here dressed that prepped are you ready for this very thinly slice nine thai chilies three serrano chilis okay 12 chili total good amount no chili's two small shallots shallots of garlic garlic good true stems no leaves oh oh no no first mistake not cilantro stem green curry you need cilantro root cilantro root root and stem difference somebody didn't pay attention in biology class stuck of lemongrass a two inch knob of peeled galangal please here okay galangal is key that right unless dom replace kalanka with ginger kalankau and ginger not the same thing people who think ginger can replace kalang gao are the same people who think jaime oliver can cook quickly very finely chiffonade three kaffir lime leaves now since these are all getting out good chopping in order to make grinding easier align mine up i get a large mortar and pestle certain passage correct correct grind those with your pestle white grind don't grind high yeah just like nephew nick you don't want to grind uncle joshua you want to pound go watch my green curry we joke go see how good uncle roger is at pounding that how i gonna win the heart of anti-esta your pestle until you get a powder then get a towel underneath because you're destroying your countertop follow that up with your sliced thai chili good pounding should always destroy countertops granules into he pounding here okay he's pounding and really get in there and grind pound thing wait wait that that it he just pound two stroke and he finished feel bad for his girlfriend just two stroke high uncle roger can pound at least twice as long this will take two to three minutes depending on your technique i rough shot my slice skill angle and added that grind that down until it's pestified another one to two minutes the natural lemongrass which has also been pretty finely chopped actually don't need chops so fine because it's gonna get pounded to [\u00a0__\u00a0] anyway this is where technique comes in pal use human instinct sensual spark technique use your grinder to press it that's not even pounding what technique you twist your pencil to get it nice you want technique go watch mock wind mother-in-law that's the right technique not this stirring [\u00a0__\u00a0] till smooth followed by coriander stem also till smooth coriander root not stem your garlic smooth smooth and last but not least finish that off with a half teaspoon or four grams for you correct correct shrimp is good and he used a lot that's the right amount not the wide amount good job uncle joshua blending all that together tooling in at around 15 to 20 minutes of grinding yes it's tedious but the effort turns into reward when everyone is moaning at the dinner table though morning at dinner table this cooking wee joe not only fan you'll know it's smooth enough if you can form a what you're doing hey yo it's the green curry this is not play-doh don't play with your food uncle joshua this green curry looked like my ex-wife before makeup my god can i have your autographed so on to the easiest part the curry in a medium sized pot add 2 tablespoons or 28 milliliters okay or go in there over medium heat until hot hot bing-bong then add all of your curry paste wait what all of it curry paste already no no no uncle joshua no green curry got two method first step you either fry the coconut milk to split the oil up like how uncle roger do or you do more home style well you mix the curry paste in water and boil it like how much weed mother-in-law do you don't just stir-fry the curry paste big mistake here cook that guy down stirring often until it's relatively dried out and is starting to stick to the bottom of the pan about three to four minutes then stir in five cloves of very finely chopped garlic garlic cook for about 25 but you have garlic in your paste already of a cup or 177 milliliters of chicken stock wait chicken stock no chicken stock 177 milliliters of chicken stock chicken stock should not be first liquid in there when the coconut milk gonna come uncle roger waiting here half an hour now coconut milk still not here are you growing the coconut tree right now joshua why wait so long for coconut milk where the coconut milk chicken stock we put near the end used to thin out the curry not the first thing to go in uh yeah curry paste then add 1 tablespoon or 17 grams of palm sugar in palm sugar correct remember don't use white sugar white sugar for white people palm sugar and two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of fish sauce fish sauce good is dissolved then add one 13.5 ounce or four finally the coconut milk goat in milk followed by three additional kefir lime leaves bring that to a light simmer and reduce the heat to low and if you wanted ultra velvety smooth then at this point you would blend it with water until as smooth as you like no need head what what he doing no need hand planted you already pound it it's so smooth that just chicken stock and tree leaf in there plan what blend he just trying to show off his blender or something bring it to a light simmer and reduce the heat to low look at this curry color it's so white this jamie oliver layer well white hi this curry is so white it about to ask uncle roger where i really from add in three quarters of a pound or 340 grams of boneless and skinless chicken thighs cut into okay at least that correct in and simmer for seven to eight minutes or until the chicken is cooked through now it's veggie time yay something healthy for once something healthy hi joshua you want healthy go drink smoothie thai green curry don't eat healthy just make it taste good make it taste good fully allergic to night shades then maybe not one to two thai eggplants sliced about half he say what what anyway add one to two thai eggplants that not thai eggplant this video is starting to unravel now this just regular eggplant regular eggplant is the emoji you use when nephew trying to be dirty thai eggplant don't look like that high thai eggplant little round ball remind me of my testicle just round and green sorry [\u00a0__\u00a0] uncle roger should get that checked and that also a lot of eggplant there's so much fiber you're gonna [\u00a0__\u00a0] yourself for a month high uh it's about half an inch thick serve that in and simmer for four minutes or until soft then follow that with one half what a hundred 160 grams of snow peas and then just snow pea no no no that is munch too that is what jamie olive oil do in his thai green curry we show no munch to the worst vegetable uncle roger i have to put my leg down from chair this jamie mistake uncle joshua what happened what happened uncle roger take his uncle title away hi yeah what happened uncle [Music] one and a half cups or 160 grams of snow peas this looks so similar to jamie olive oil curry i think jamie oliver will see this curry he gonna go oh this green curry looks just like my green curry it looks really good yeah yeah first uncle gordon loses uncle taito and now joshua also they are the same as auntie helen they just let uncle roger down set so much pain in my heart high yeah i like my snap peas to have some crunch to them so one to two minutes is usually enough and once it's done season then to taste with the juice of one lime lime wrong fish sauce and or palm sugar if you feel like it needs it albeit optional way to save it now large sprigs of thai basil in the hot curry to release them [Music] look at this look at this look more like vegetable soup hi yeah where the thai green curry now you have an incredible curry which should be no it's not incredible nice big bowl beautiful i can't watch anymore and nice heaping ladle fulls of curry on the other see this fried shallots no need fried shallot too fancy and also who eat green curry like this asian people we eat green curry we put green curry in bowl and just scoop into rice only white people do this they spit the curry out the curry cannot touch the rice it like east and west germany what is it about white people and segregation slice serrano chili and fresh thai basil leaves now this bowl right here in my opinion pays respect and homage to one of the greatest curries in the entire world pay respect pay respect to who jamie oliver is it first i think we should just go for the the curry itself aside from all the vegetables and proteins and everything that's in there oh my god looks so white right in the face with the most fresh tigering notice how there are no layer of oil on it it seems like it would be really spicy it's really not very palatable spice level wise i'll give this a like a four point twenty three four five six seven eight out of ten not that spicy as long as you don't launch it to the back of your throat everything comes together beautiful launch it a pack of truth who eats food like that who deep throat a thai green curry needs a nephew if you go on date and your date deep choke the food marry them immediately play perfect high green curry you can make it home and yes you should make the curry paste you're not making this without making the paste period end of story the paste every step correct but the cooking or wrong you want to know what else is creamy and makes you sweat just a little b-roll b-roll so cool for what it all [\u00a0__\u00a0] if jaime oliver liked your typical curry you [\u00a0__\u00a0] up hi yeah uncle roger disappointed now no more uncle joshua this sad moment in youtube cooking he looked less like chef and more like guy who about to talk to you about nft he nailed egg fire rice he nailed thai tom yum but he don't nail his facial hair go watch my green curry video see how good uncle roger is at pounding that's how i gonna win the heart of auntie esther you want healthy go drink vitamin water or some [\u00a0__\u00a0] you want healthy go drink kombucha you want healthy go drink white woman drink go eat yogurt parfait and smoothie or some [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh this green curry look oh i didn't wear it i need to wear a plaid shirt can't do an impression of someone just dress like them miss and nephew do you like uncle roger impression of jamie oliver what you think what you think leave comment down below you can't even tell difference and when uncle roger put on this mask and put on my checkered shirt you can't even tell difference they spit the curry out the curry cannot touch the rice like russia and ukraine [Music] i gotta get into trouble for this one put
